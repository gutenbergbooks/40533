<h1>THE LIFE OF JOHN MARSHALL</h1>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE PERIOD OF AMERICANIZATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Great Britain is fighting our battles and the battles of mankind, and France is
combating for the power to enslave and plunder us and all the world.
(Fisher Ames.)</p>

<p>Though every one of these Bugbears is an empty Phantom, yet the People
seem to believe every article of this bombastical Creed. Who shall touch
these blind eyes.  (John Adams.)</p>

</p></div>


<p>Into the life of John Marshall war was strangely
woven. His birth, his young manhood, his public
services before he became Chief Justice, were coincident
with, and affected by, war. It seemed to be
the decree of Fate that his career should march side
by side with armed conflict, and that the final phase
of that career should open with a war&mdash;a war, too,
which brought forth a National consciousness among
the people and demonstrated a National strength
hitherto unsuspected in their fundamental law.</p>

<p>Yet, while American Nationalism was Marshall's
one and only great conception, and the fostering of
it the purpose of his life, he was wholly out of sympathy
with the National movement that led to our
second conflict with Great Britain, and against the
continuance of it. He heartily shared the opinion
of the Federalist leaders that the War of 1812 was
unnecessary, unwise, and unrighteous.</p>

<p>By the time France and England had renewed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
hostilities in 1803, the sympathies of these men had
become wholly British. The excesses of the French
Revolution had started them on this course of
feeling and thinking. Their detestation of Jefferson,
their abhorrence of Republican doctrines, their resentment
of Virginia domination, all hastened their
progress toward partisanship for Great Britain.
They had, indeed, reverted to the colonial state of
mind, and the old phrases, "the mother country,"
"the protection of the British fleet,"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> were forever
on their lips.</p>

<p>These Federalists passionately hated France; to
them France was only the monstrous child of the terrible
Revolution which, in the name of human rights,
had attacked successfully every idea dear to their
hearts&mdash;upset all order, endangered all property,
overturned all respectability. They were sure that
Napoleon intended to subjugate the world; and that
Great Britain was our only bulwark against the aggressions
of the Conqueror&mdash;that "varlet" whose
"patron-saint [is] Beelzebub," as Gouverneur Morris
referred to Napoleon.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>So, too, thought John Marshall. No man, except
his kinsman Thomas Jefferson, cherished a prejudice
more fondly than he. Perhaps no better example
of first impressions strongly made and tenaciously
retained can be found than in these two men.
Jefferson was as hostile as Marshall was friendly to
Great Britain; and they held exactly opposite sentiments
toward France. Jefferson's strongest title<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
to immortality was the Declaration of Independence;
nearly all of his foreign embroilments had
been with British statesmen. In British conservatism
he had found the most resolute opposition to
those democratic reforms he so passionately championed,
and which he rightly considered the manifestations
of a world movement.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>And Jefferson adored France, in whose entrancing
capital he had spent his happiest years. There his
radical tendencies had found encouragement. He
looked upon the French Revolution as the breaking
of humanity's chains, politically, intellectually, spiritually.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
He believed that the war of the allied governments
of Europe against the new-born French
Republic was a monarchical combination to extinguish
the flame of liberty which France had lighted.</p>

<p>Marshall, on the other hand, never could forget his
experience with the French. And his revelation of
what he had endured while in Paris had brought him
his first National fame.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Then, too, his idol, Washington,
had shared his own views&mdash;indeed, Marshall
had been instrumental in the formation of
Washington's settled opinions. Marshall had championed
the Jay Treaty, and, in doing so, had necessarily
taken the side of Great Britain as opposed to
France.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> His business interests<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> powerfully inclined
him in the same direction. His personal friends were
the ageing Federalists.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>He had also become obsessed with an almost religious
devotion to the rights of property, to steady
government by "the rich, the wise and good,"<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> to
"respectable" society. These convictions Marshall
found most firmly retained and best defended in the
commercial centers of the East and North. The
stoutest champions of Marshall's beloved stability
of institutions and customs were the old Federalist
leaders, particularly of New England and New
York. They had been his comrades and associates
in bygone days and continued to be his intimates.</p>

<p>In short, John Marshall had become the personification
of the reaction against popular government
that followed the French Revolution. With him and
men of his cast of mind, Great Britain had come to
represent all that was enduring and good, and France
all that was eruptive and evil. Such was his outlook
on social and political life when, after these
traditional European foes were again at war, their
spoliations of American commerce, violations of
American rights, and insults to American honor
once more became flagrant; and such continued to
be his opinion and feeling after these aggressions
had become intolerable.</p>

<p>Since the adoption of the Constitution, nearly
all Americans, except the younger generation, had
become re-Europeanized in thought and feeling.
Their partisanship of France and Great Britain
relegated America to a subordinate place in their
minds and hearts. Just as the anti-Federalists and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
their successors, the Republicans, had been more
concerned in the triumph of revolutionary France
over "monarchical" England than in the maintenance
of American interests, rights, and honor, so
now the Federalists were equally violent in their
championship of Great Britain in her conflict with
the France of Napoleon. Precisely as the French
partisans of a few years earlier had asserted that
the cause of France was that of America also,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
the Federalists now insisted that the success of
Great Britain meant the salvation of the United
States.</p>

<p>"Great Britain is fighting our battles and the battles
of mankind, and France is combating for the
power to enslave and plunder us and all the world,"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
wrote that faithful interpreter of extreme New
England Federalism, Fisher Ames, just after the
European conflict was renewed. Such opinions were
not confined to the North and East. In South Carolina,
John Rutledge was under the same spell.
Writing to "the head Quarters of good Principles,"
Boston, he avowed that "I have long considered
England as but the advanced guard of our
Country.... If they fall we do."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Scores of quotations
from prominent Federalists expressive of the
same views might be adduced.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Even the assault on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the Chesapeake did not change or even soften them.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
On the other hand, the advocates of France as
ardently upheld her cause, as fiercely assailed Great
Britain.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Never did Americans more seriously need emancipation
from foreign influence than in the early decades
of the Republic&mdash;never was it more vital to
their well-being that the people should develop an
American spirit, than at the height of the Napoleonic
Wars.</p>

<p>Upon the renewal of the European conflict, Great
Britain announced wholesale blockades of French
ports,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> ordered the seizure of neutral ships wherever
found carrying on trade with an enemy of
England;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and forbade them to enter the harbors
of immense stretches of European coasts.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In reply,
Napoleon declared the British Islands to be
under blockade, and ordered the capture in any
waters whatsoever of all ships that had entered
British harbors.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Great Britain responded with the
Orders in Council of 1807 which, in effect, prohib<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>ited
the oceans to neutral vessels except such as
traded directly with England or her colonies; and
even this commerce was made subject to a special
tax to be paid into the British treasury.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Napoleon's
swift answer was the Milan Decree,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> which,
among other things, directed all ships submitting
to the British Orders in Council to be seized and
confiscated in the ports of France or her allies, or
captured on the high seas.</p>

<p>All these "decrees," "orders," and "instructions"
were, of course, in flagrant violation of international
law, and were more injurious to America than to all
other neutrals put together. Both belligerents bore
down upon American commerce and seized American
ships with equal lawlessness.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> But, since Great
Britain commanded the oceans,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> the United States
suffered far more severely from the depredations
of that Power.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Under pressure of conflict, Great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Britain increased her impressment<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> of American
sailors. In effect, our ports were blockaded.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson's lifelong prejudice against Great Britain<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
would permit him to see in all this nothing but a
sordid and brutal imperialism. Not for a moment did
he understand or consider the British point of view.
England's "intentions have been to claim the ocean
as her conquest, &amp; prohibit any vessel from navigating
it but on ... tribute," he wrote.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Nevertheless,
he met Great Britain's orders and instructions with
hesitant recommendations that the country be put
in a state of defense; only feeble preliminary steps
were taken to that end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>The President's principal reliance was on the
device of taking from Great Britain her American
markets. So came the Non-Importation Act of
April, 1806, prohibiting the admission of those
products that constituted the bulk of Great Britain's
immensely profitable trade with the United
States.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> This economic measure was of no avail&mdash;it
amounted to little more than an encouragement of
successful smuggling.</p>

<p>When the Leopard attacked the Chesapeake,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Jefferson issued his proclamation reciting the "enormity"
as he called it, and ordering all British armed
vessels from American waters.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The spirit of America
was at last aroused.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Demands for war rang
throughout the land.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> But they did not come from
the lips of Federalists, who, with a few exceptions,
protested loudly against any kind of retaliation.</p>

<p>John Lowell, unequaled in talent and learning
among the brilliant group of Federalists in Boston,
wrote a pamphlet in defense of British conduct.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
It was an uncommonly able performance, bright, informed,
witty, well reasoned. "Despising the threats
of prosecution for treason," he would, said Lowell,
use his right of free speech to save the country from
an unjustifiable war. What did the Chesapeake
incident, what did impressment of Americans, what
did anything and everything amount to, compared
to the one tremendous fact of Great Britain's
struggle with France? All thoughtful men knew that
Great Britain alone stood between us and that
slavery which would be our portion if France should
prevail.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Lowell's sparkling essay well set forth the intense
conviction of nearly all leading Federalists. Giles
was not without justification when he branded them
as "the mere Anglican party."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The London press
had approved the attack on the Chesapeake, applauded
Admiral Berkeley, and even insisted upon
war against the United States.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> American Federalists
were not far behind the <i>Times</i> and the <i>Morning
Post</i>.</p>

<p>Jefferson, on the contrary, vividly stated the
thought of the ordinary American: "The English
being equally tyrannical at sea as he [Bonaparte] is
on land, &amp; that tyranny bearing on us in every point
of either honor or interest, I say, 'down with Eng<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>land'
and as for what Buonaparte is then to do to
us, let us trust to the chapter of accidents, I cannot,
with the Anglomen, prefer a certain present evil to
a future hypothetical one."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>But the President did not propose to execute his
policy of "down with England" by any such horrid
method as bloodshed. He would stop Americans
from trading with the world&mdash;that would prevent
the capture of our ships and the impressment of our
seamen.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Thus it was that the Embargo Act of
December, 1807, and the supplementary acts of
January, March, and April, 1808, were passed.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
All exportation by sea or land was rigidly forbidden
under heavy penalties. Even coasting vessels were
not allowed to continue purely American trade unless
heavy bond was given that landing would be
made exclusively at American ports. Flour could be
shipped by sea only in case the President thought
it necessary to keep from hunger the population of
any given port.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>Here was an exercise of National power such as
John Marshall had never dreamed of. The effect
was disastrous. American ocean-carrying trade was
ruined; British ships were given the monopoly of
the seas.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> And England was not "downed," as Jefferson
expected. In fact neither France nor Great
Britain relaxed its practices in the least.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The commercial interests demanded the repeal of
the Embargo laws,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> so ruinous to American shipping,
so destructive to American trade, so futile in redressing
the wrongs we had suffered. Massachusetts
was enraged. A great proportion of the tonnage
of the whole country was owned in that State
and the Embargo had paralyzed her chief industry.
Here was a fresh source of grievance against the
Administration and a just one. Jefferson had, at
last, given the Federalists a real issue. Had they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
availed themselves of it on economic and purely
American grounds, they might have begun the
rehabilitation of their weakened party throughout
the country. But theirs were the vices of pride and
of age&mdash;they could neither learn nor forget; could
not estimate situations as they really were, but only
as prejudice made them appear to be.</p>

<p>As soon as Congress convened in November, 1808,
New England opened the attack on Jefferson's retaliatory
measures. Senator James Hillhouse of
Connecticut offered a resolution for the repeal of the
obnoxious statutes. "Great Britain was not to be
threatened into compliance by a rod of coercion,"
he said.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Pickering made a speech which might
well have been delivered in Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> British
maritime practices were right, the Embargo wrong,
and principally injurious to America.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The Orders in
Council had been issued only after Great Britain
"had witnessed ... these atrocities" committed by
Napoleon and his plundering armies, "and seen the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
deadly weapon aimed at her vitals." Yet Jefferson
had acted very much as if the United States were a
vassal of France.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Again Pickering addressed the Senate, flatly charging
that all Embargo measures were "in exact conformity
with the views and wishes of the French
Emperor, ... the most ruthless tyrant that has
scourged the European world, since the Roman Empire
fell!" Suppose the British Navy were destroyed
and France triumphant over Great Britain&mdash;to the
other titles of Bonaparte would then "be added
that of Emperor of the Two Americas"; for what
legions of soldiers "could he not send to the United
States in the thousands of British ships, were they
also at his command?"<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>As soon as they were printed, Pickering sent
copies of these and speeches of other Federalists to
his close associate, the Chief Justice of the United
States. Marshall's prompt answer shows how far he
had gone in company with New England Federalist
opinion.</p>

<p>"I thank you very sincerely," he wrote "for the
excellent speeches lately delivered in the senate....
If sound argument &amp; correct reasoning could save
our country it would be saved. Nothing can be
more completely demonstrated than the inefficacy
of the embargo, yet that demonstration seems to
be of no avail. I fear most seriously that the same
spirit which so tenaciously maintains this measure
will impel us to a war with the only power which
protects any part of the civilized world from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
despotism of that tyrant with whom we shall then
be ravaged."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Such was the change that nine years had wrought
in the views of John Marshall. When Secretary of
State he had arraigned Great Britain for her conduct
toward neutrals, denounced the impressment
of American sailors, and branded her admiralty
courts as habitually unjust if not corrupt.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> But his
hatred of France had metamorphosed the man.</p>

<p>Before Marshall had written this letter, the Legislature
of Massachusetts formally declared that the
continuance of the Embargo would "endanger ... the
union of these States."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Talk of secession was steadily
growing in New England.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The National Government
feared open rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Only one eminent
Federalist dissented from these views of the party
leaders which Marshall also held as fervently as
they. That man was the one to whom he owed his
place on the Supreme Bench. From his retirement
in Quincy, John Adams watched the growing excitement
with amused contempt.</p>

<p>"Our Gazettes and Pamphlets," he wrote, "tell
us that Bonaparte ... will conquer England, and
command all the British Navy, and send I know not
how many hundred thousand soldiers here and con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>quer
from New Orleans to Passamaquoddy. Though
every one of these Bugbears is an empty Phantom,
yet the People seem to believe every article of this
bombastical Creed and tremble and shudder in Consequence.
Who shall touch these blind eyes?"<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>On January 9, 1809, Jefferson signed the "Force
Act," which the Republican Congress had defiantly
passed, and again Marshall beheld such an assertion
of National power as the boldest Federalist of
Alien and Sedition times never had suggested. Collectors
of customs were authorized to seize any
vessel or wagon if they suspected the owner of an
intention to evade the Embargo laws; ships could be
laden only in the presence of National officials, and
sailing delayed or prohibited arbitrarily. Rich rewards
were provided for informers who should put
the Government on the track of any violation of the
multitude of restrictions of these statutes or of the
Treasury regulations interpretative of them. The
militia, the army, the navy were to be employed to
enforce obedience.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Along the New England coasts popular wrath swept
like a forest fire. Violent resolutions were passed.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
The Collector of Boston, Benjamin Lincoln, refused
to obey the law and resigned.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The Legislature of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Massachusetts passed a bill denouncing the "Force
Act" as unconstitutional, and declaring any officer
entering a house in execution of it to be guilty of a
high misdemeanor, punishable by fine and imprisonment.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
The Governor of Connecticut declined the
request of the Secretary of War to afford military
aid and addressed the Legislature in a speech bristling
with sedition.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The Embargo must go, said the
Federalists, or New England would appeal to arms.
Riots broke out in many towns. Withdrawal from
the Union was openly advocated.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Nor was this
sentiment confined to that section. "If the question
were barely <i>stirred</i> in New England, some States
would drop off the Union like fruit, <i>rotten ripe</i>,"
wrote A. C. Hanson of Baltimore.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Humphrey
Marshall of Kentucky declared that he looked to
"<span class="smcap">Boston</span> ... the Cradle, and <span class="smcap">Salem</span>, the nourse, of
American Liberty," as "the source of reformation,
or should that be unattainable, of disunion."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Warmly as he sympathized with Federalist opinion
of the absurd Republican retaliatory measures, and
earnestly as he shared Federalist partisanship for
Great Britain, John Marshall deplored all talk of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
secession and sternly rebuked resistance to National
authority, as is shown in his opinion in Fletcher
<i>vs.</i> Peck,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> wherein he asserted the sovereignty of the
Nation over a State.</p>

<p>Another occasion, however, gave Marshall a better
opportunity to state his views more directly, and to
charge them with the whole force of the concurrence
of all his associates on the Supreme Bench. This
occasion was the resistance of the Legislature and
Governor of Pennsylvania to a decree of Richard
Peters, Judge of the United States Court for that
district, rendered in the notable and dramatic case
of Gideon Olmstead. During the Revolution, Olmstead
and three other American sailors captured the
British sloop Active and sailed for Egg Harbor, New
Jersey. Upon nearing their destination, they were
overhauled by an armed vessel belonging to the
State of Pennsylvania and by an American privateer.
The Active was taken to Philadelphia and claimed as
a prize of war. The court awarded Olmstead and his
comrades only one fourth of the proceeds of the sale
of the vessel, the other three fourths going to the
State of Pennsylvania, to the officers and crew of
the State ship, and to those of the privateer. The
Continental Prize Court reversed the decision and
ordered the whole amount received for sloop and
cargo to be paid to Olmstead and his associates.</p>

<p>This the State court refused to do, and a litigation
began which lasted for thirty years. The funds were
invested in United States loan certificates, and these
were delivered by the State Judge to the State Treas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>urer,
David Rittenhouse, upon a bond saving the
Judge harmless in case he, thereafter, should be compelled
to pay the amount in controversy to Olmstead.
Rittenhouse kept the securities in his personal possession,
and after his death they were found among
his effects with a note in his handwriting that they
would become the property of Pennsylvania when
the State released him from his bond to the Judge.</p>

<p>In 1803, Olmstead secured from Judge Peters an
order to the daughters of Rittenhouse who, as his executrixes,
had possession of the securities, to deliver
them to Olmstead and his associates. This proceeding
of the National court was promptly met by an
act of the State Legislature which declared that
the National court had "usurped" jurisdiction, and
directed the Governor to "protect the just rights of
the state ... from any process whatever issued out
of any federal court."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Peters, a good lawyer and an upright judge, but a
timorous man, was cowed by this sharp defiance and
did nothing. The executrixes held on to the securities.
At last, on March 5, 1808, Olmstead applied to
the Supreme Court of the United States for a rule
directed to Judge Peters to show cause why a mandamus
should not issue compelling him to execute
his decree. Peters made return that the act of the
State Legislature had caused him "from prudential ... motives ... to
avoid embroiling the government
of the United States and that of Pennsylvania."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Thus the matter came before Marshall. On February
20, 1809, just when threats of resistance to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
"Force Act" were sounding loudest, when riots
were in progress along the New England seaboard,
and a storm of debate over the Embargo and Non-Intercourse
laws was raging in Congress, the Chief
Justice delivered his opinion in the case of the
United States <i>vs.</i> Peters.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The court had, began
Marshall, considered the return of Judge Peters
"with great attention, and with serious concern."
The act of the Pennsylvania Legislature challenged
the very life of the National Government, for, "if the
legislatures of the several states may, at will, annul
the judgments of the courts of the United States,
and destroy the rights acquired under those judgments,
the constitution itself becomes a solemn
mockery, and the nation is deprived of the means
of enforcing its laws by the instrumentality of its
own tribunals."</p>

<p>These clear, strong words were addressed to Massachusetts
and Connecticut no less than to Pennsylvania.
They were meant for Marshall's Federalist
comrades and friends&mdash;for Pickering, and Gore,
and Morris, and Otis&mdash;as much as for the State
officials in Lancaster. His opinion was not confined
to the case before him; it was meant for the whole
country and especially for those localities where
National laws were being denounced and violated,
and National authority defied and flouted. Considering
the depth and fervor of Marshall's feelings
on the whole policy of the Republican r&eacute;gime,
his opinion in United States <i>vs.</i> Judge Peters was
signally brave and noble.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Forcible resistance by a State to National authority!
"So fatal a result must be deprecated by all; and
the people of Pennsylvania, <i>not less than the citizens of
every other state</i>, must feel a deep interest in resisting
principles so destructive of the Union, and in averting
consequences so fatal to themselves." Marshall
then states the facts of the controversy and concludes
that "the state of Pennsylvania can possess no
constitutional right" to resist the authority of the
National courts. His decision, he says, "is not made
without extreme regret at the necessity which has induced
the application." But, because "it is a solemn
duty" to do so, the "mandamus must be awarded."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's opinion deeply angered the Legislature
and officials of Pennsylvania.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> When Judge Peters, in
obedience to the order of the Supreme Court, directed
the United States Marshal to enforce the decree in
Olmstead's favor, that official found the militia under
command of General Bright drawn up around the
house of the two executrixes. The dispute was at
last composed, largely because President Madison rebuked
Pennsylvania and upheld the National courts.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>A week after the delivery of Marshall's opinion,
the most oppressive provisions of the Embargo Acts
were repealed and a curious non-intercourse law
enacted.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> One section directed the suspension of
all commercial restrictions against France or Great
Britain in case either belligerent revoked its orders
or decrees against the United States; and this the
President was to announce by proclamation. The
new British Minister, David M. Erskine, now tendered
apology and reparation for the attack on the
Chesapeake and positively assured the Administration
that, if the United States would renew intercourse
with Great Britain, the British Orders in
Council would be withdrawn on June 10, 1809. Immediately
President Madison issued his proclamation
stating this fact and announcing that after that
happy June day, Americans might renew their long
and ruinously suspended trade with all the world not
subject to French control.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The Federalists were jubilant.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> But their joy was
quickly turned to wrath&mdash;against the Administration.
Great Britain repudiated the agreement of her
Minister, recalled him, and sent another charged
with rigid and impossible instructions.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> In deep
humiliation, Madison issued a second proclamation
reciting the facts and restoring to full operation
against Great Britain all the restrictive commercial
and maritime laws remaining on the statute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
books.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> At a banquet in Richmond, Jefferson proposed
a toast: "The freedom of the seas!"<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Upon the arrival of Francis James Jackson, Erskine's
successor as British Minister, the scenes of the
Gen&ecirc;t drama<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> were repeated. Jackson was arrogant
and overbearing, and his instructions were as harsh as
his disposition.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Soon the Administration was forced
to refuse further conference with him. Jackson then
issued an appeal to the American people in the form
of a circular to British Consuls in America, accusing
the American Government of trickery, concealment
of facts, and all but downright falsehood.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> A letter
of Canning to the American Minister at London<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
found its way into the Federalist newspapers, "doubtless
by the connivance of the British Minister," says
Joseph Story. This letter was, Story thought, an
"infamous" appeal to the American people to repudiate
their own Government, "the old game of
Gen&ecirc;t played over again."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Furious altercations arose all over the country.
The Federalists defended Jackson. When the elections
came on, the Republicans made tremendous
gains in New England as well as in other States,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
a circumstance that depressed Marshall profoundly.
In December an acrimonious debate arose in Congress
over a resolution denouncing Jackson's circular
letter as a "direct and aggravated insult and affront
to the American people and their Government."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Every Federalist opposed the resolution. Josiah
Quincy of Massachusetts declared that every word
of it was a "falsehood," and that the adoption of
it would call forth "severe retribution, perhaps in
war" from Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Disheartened, disgusted, wrathful, Marshall wrote
Quincy: "The Federalists of the South participate
with their brethren of the North in the gloomy anticipations
which your late elections must inspire.
The proceedings of the House of Representatives already
demonstrate the influence of those elections on
the affairs of the Union. I had supposed that the late
letter to Mr. Armstrong,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and the late seizure [by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the French] of an American vessel, simply because
she was an American, added to previous burnings,
ransoms, and confiscations, would have exhausted
to the dregs our cup of servility and degradation;
but these measures appear to make no impression
on those to whom the United States confide their
destinies. To what point are we verging?"<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Nor did the Chief Justice keep quiet in Richmond.
"We have lost our resentment for the severest injuries
a nation ever suffered, because of their being
so often repeated. Nay, Judge Marshall and Mr.
Pickering &amp; Co. found out Great Britain had given
us no cause of complaint,"<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> writes John Tyler. And
ever nearer drew the inevitable conflict.</p>

<p>Jackson was unabashed by the condemnation of
Congress, and not without reason. Wherever he
went, more invitations to dine than he could accept
poured in upon him from the "best families"; banquets
were given in his honor; the Senate of Massachusetts
adopted resolutions condemning the Administration
and upholding Jackson, who declared that
the State had "done more towards justifying me to
the world than it was possible ... that I or any other
person could do."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The talk of secession grew.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> At<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
a public banquet given Jackson, Pickering proposed
the toast: "The world's last hope&mdash;Britain's fast-anchored
isle!" It was greeted with a storm of
cheers. Pickering's words sped over the country and
became the political war cry of Federalism.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Marshall,
who in Richmond was following "with anxiety"
all political news, undoubtedly read it, and
his letters show that Pickering's words stated the
opinion of the Chief Justice.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Upon the assurance of the French Foreign Minister
that the Berlin and Milan Decrees would be revoked
after November 1, 1810, President Madison,
on November 2, announced what he believed to be
Napoleon's settled determination, and recommended
the resumption of commercial relations with France
and the suspension of all intercourse with Great
Britain unless that Power also withdrew its injurious
and offensive Orders in Council.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>When at Washington, Marshall was frequently in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Pickering's company. Before the Chief Justice left
for Richmond, the Massachusetts Senator had lent
him pamphlets containing part of John Adams's
"Cunningham Correspondence." In returning them,
Marshall wrote that he had read Adams's letters
"with regret." But the European war, rather than
the "Cunningham Correspondence," was on the
mind of the Chief Justice: "We are looking with
anxiety towards the metropolis for political intelligence.
Report gives much importance to the communications
of Serrurier [the new French Minister],<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
&amp; proclaims him to be charged with requisitions on
our government, a submission to which would seem
to be impossible.... I will flatter myself that I have
not seen you for the last time. Events have so fully
demonstrated the correctness of your opinions on
subjects the most interesting to our country that I
cannot permit myself to believe the succeeding legislature
of Massachusetts will deprive the nation of
your future services."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>As the Federalist faith in Great Britain grew
stronger, Federalist distrust of the youthful and
growing American people increased. Early in 1811,
the bill to admit Louisiana was considered. The
Federalists violently resisted it. Josiah Quincy declared
that "if this bill passes, the bonds of this
Union are virtually dissolved; that the States which
compose it are free from their moral obligations, and
that, as it will be the right of all, so it will be the
duty of some, to prepare definitely for a separation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>&mdash;amicably
if they can, violently if they must."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
Quincy was the embodiment of the soul of Localism:
"The first public love of my heart is the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts. There is my fireside;
there are the tombs of my ancestors."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The spirit of American Nationalism no longer
dwelt in the breasts of even the youngest of the
Federalist leaders. Its abode now was the hearts of
the people of the West and South; and its strongest
exponent was a young Kentuckian, Henry Clay,
whose feelings and words were those of the heroic
seventies. Although but thirty-three years old, he
had been appointed for the second time to fill an
unexpired term in the National Senate. On February
22, 1810, he addressed that body on the country's
wrongs and duty: "Have we not been for years
contending against the tyranny of the ocean?" We
have tried "<i>peaceful</i> resistance.... When this is abandoned
without effect, I am for resistance by the
<i>sword</i>."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Two years later, in the House, to which he
was elected immediately after his term in the Senate
expired, and of which he was promptly chosen
Speaker, Clay again made an appeal to American
patriotism: "The real cause of British aggression was
not to distress an enemy, but to destroy a rival!"<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
he passionately exclaimed. Another Patrick Henry
had arisen to lead America to a new independence.</p>

<p>Four other young Representatives from the West
and South, John C. Calhoun, William Lowndes,
Langdon Cheves, and Felix Grundy were as hot for
war as was Henry Clay.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Clay's speeches, extravagant, imprudent, and grandiose,
had at least one merit: they were thoroughly
American and expressed the opinion of the first
generation of Americans that had grown up since
the colonies won their freedom. Henry Clay spoke
their language. But it was not the language of the
John Marshall of 1812.</p>

<p>Eventually the Administration was forced to act.
On June 1, 1812, President Madison sent to Congress
his Message which briefly, and with moderation,
stated the situation.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> On June 4, the House
passed a bill declaring war on Great Britain. Every
Federalist but three voted against it.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The Senate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
made unimportant amendments which the House
accepted;<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and thus, on June 18, war was formally
declared.</p>

<p>At the Fourth of July banquet of the Boston Federalists,
among the toasts, by drinking to which the
company exhilarated themselves, was this sentiment:
"<i>The Existing War</i>&mdash;The Child of Prostitution, may
no American acknowledge it legitimate."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Joseph
Story was profoundly alarmed: "I am thoroughly
convinced," he wrote, "that the leading Federalists
meditate a severance of the Union."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> His apprehension
was justified: "Let the Union be severed.
Such a severance presents no terrors to me," wrote
the leading Federalist of New England.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>While opposition to the war thus began to blaze
into open and defiant treason in that section,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
old-time Southern Federalists, who detested it no
less, sought a more practical, though more timid, way
to resist and end it. "Success in this War, would most
probably be the worst kind of ruin," wrote Benjamin
Stoddert to the sympathetic James McHenry.
"There is but one way to save our Country ... change
the administration&mdash;... this can be affected by
bringing forward another Virgn. as the competitor of
Madison." For none but a Virginian can get the
Presidential electors of that State, said Stoddert.</p>

<p>"There is, then, but one man to be thought of as
the candidate of the Federalists and of all who were
against the war. That man is John Marshall." Stoddert
informs McHenry that he has written an article
for a Maryland Federalist paper, the <i>Spirit of
Seventy-Six</i>, recommending Marshall for President.
"This I have done, because ... every body else ... seems
to be seized with apathy ... and because I felt
it sacred duty."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Stoddert's newspaper appeal for Marshall's nomination
was clear, persuasive, and well reasoned. It
opened with the familiar Federalist arguments
against the war. It was an "<i>offensive</i> war," which
meant the ruin of America. "Thus thinking ... I feel
it a solemn duty to my countrymen, to name <span class="smcap">John
Marshall</span>, as a man as highly gifted as any other in
the United States, for the important office of Chief
Magistrate; and more likely than any other to com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>mand
the confidence, and unite the votes of that
description of men, of all parties, who desire nothing
from government, but that it should be wisely and
faithfully administered....</p>

<p>"The sterling integrity of this gentleman's character
and his high elevation of mind, forbid the suspicion,
that he could descend to be a mere party
President, or less than the President of the whole
people:&mdash;but one objection can be urged against
him by candid and honorable men: He is a Virginian,
and Virginia has already furnished more than
her full share of Presidents&mdash;This objection in less
critical times would be entitled to great weight; but
situated as the world is, and as we are, the only consideration
now should be, who amongst our ablest
statesmen, can best unite the suffrages of the citizens
of all parties, in a competition with Mr. Madison,
whose continuance in power is incompatible with
the safety of the nation?...</p>

<p>"It may happen," continues Stoddert, "that this
our beloved country may be ruined for want of the
services of the great and good man I have been
prompted by sacred duty to introduce, from the
mere want of energy among those of his immediate
countrymen [Virginians], who think of his virtues
and talents as I do; and as I do of the crisis which
demands their employment.</p>

<p>"If in his native state men of this description will
act in concert, &amp; with a vigor called for by the occasion,
and will let the people fairly know, that the
contest is between John Marshall, peace, and a new
order of things; and James Madison, Albert Gallatin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and war, with war taxes, war loans, and all the other
dreadful evils of a war in the present state of the
world, my life for it they will succeed, and by a considerable
majority of the independent votes of Virginia."</p>

<p>Stoddert becomes so enthusiastic that he thinks
victory possible without the assistance of Marshall's
own State: "Even if they fail in Virginia, the very
effort will produce an animation in North Carolina,
the middle and Eastern states, that will most probably
secure the election of John Marshall. At the
worst nothing can be lost but a little labour in a good
cause, and everything may be saved, or gained for
our country." Stoddert signs his plea "A Maryland
Farmer."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>In his letter to McHenry he says: "They vote for
electors in Virga. by a general ticket, and I am
thoroughly persuaded that if the men in that State,
who prefer Marshall to Madison, can be animated
into Exertion, he will get the votes of that State.
What little I can do by private letters to affect this
will be done." Stoddert had enlisted one John Davis,
an Englishman&mdash;writer, traveler, and generally
a rolling stone&mdash;in the scheme to nominate Marshall.
Davis, it seems, went to Virginia on this mission.
After investigating conditions in that State,
he had informed Stoddert "that if the Virgns. have
nerve to believe it will be agreeable to the Northern
&amp; E. States, he is sure Marshall will get the Virga.
votes."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Stoddert dwells with the affection and anxiety of
parentage upon his idea of Marshall for President:
"It is not because I prefer Marshall to several other
men, that I speak of him&mdash;but because I am well
convinced it is vain to talk of any other man, and
Marshall is a Man in whom Fedts. may confide&mdash;Perhaps
indeed he is the man for the crisis, which demands
great good sense, a great firmness under the
garb of great moderation." He then urges McHenry
to get to work for Marshall&mdash;"support a cause
[election of a peace President] on which all that is
dear to you depends."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Stoddert also wrote two
letters to William Coleman of New York, editor of
the <i>New York Evening Post</i>, urging Marshall for the
Presidency.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Twelve days after Stoddert thus instructed McHenry,
Marshall wrote strangely to Robert Smith
of Maryland. President Madison had dismissed
Smith from the office of Secretary of State for inefficiency
in the conduct of our foreign affairs and for
intriguing with his brother, Senator Samuel Smith,
and others against the Administration's foreign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
policy.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Upon his ejection from the Cabinet, Smith
proceeded to "vindicate" himself by publishing a
dull and pompous "Address" in which he asserted
that we must have a President "of energetic mind,
of enlarged and liberal views, of temperate and dignified
deportment, of honourable and manly feelings,
and as efficient in maintaining, as sagacious
in discerning the rights of our much-injured and insulted
country."<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> This was a good summary of
Marshall's qualifications.</p>

<p>When Stoddert proposed Marshall for the Presidency,
Smith wrote the Chief Justice, enclosing a
copy of his attack on the Administration. On July
27, 1812, more than five weeks after the United States
had declared war, Marshall replied: "Although I
have for several years forborn to intermingle with
those questions which agitate &amp; excite the feelings of
party, it is impossible that I could be inattentive to
passing events, or an unconcerned observer of them."
But "as they have increased in their importance, the
interest, which as an American I must take in them,
has also increased; and the declaration of war has
appeared to me, as it has to you, to be one of those
portentous acts which ought to concentrate on itself
the efforts of all those who can take an active
part in rescuing their country from the ruin it
threatens.</p>

<p>"All minor considerations should be waived; the
lines of subdivision between parties, if not absolutely
effaced, should at least be convened for a time;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and the great division between the friends of peace
&amp; the advocates of war ought alone to remain. It is
an object of such magnitude as to give to almost
every other, comparative insignificance; and all who
wish peace ought to unite in the means which may
facilitate its attainment, whatever may have been
their differences of opinion on other points."<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>Marshall proceeds to analyze the causes of hostilities.
These, he contends, were Madison's subserviency
to France and the base duplicity of Napoleon.
The British Government and American Federalists
had, from the first, asserted that the Emperor's
revocation of the Berlin and Milan Decrees was a
mere trick to entrap that credulous French partisan,
Madison; and this they maintained with ever-increasing
evidence to support them. For, in spite
of Napoleon's friendly words, American ships were
still seized by the French as well as by the British.</p>

<p>In response to the demand of Joel Barlow, the new
American Minister to France, for a forthright statement
as to whether the obnoxious decrees against
neutral commerce had or had not been revoked as
to the United States, the French Foreign Minister
delivered to Barlow a new decree. This document,
called "The Decree of St. Cloud," declared that the
former edicts of Napoleon, of which the American
Government complained, "are definitively, and to
date from the 1st day of November last [1810], considered
as not having existed [<i>non avenus</i>] in regard to
American vessels." The "decree" was dated April 28,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
1811, yet it was handed to Barlow on May 10, 1812.
It expressly stated, moreover, that Napoleon issued
it because the American Congress had, by the Act
of May 2, 1811, prohibited "the vessels and merchandise
of Great Britain ... from entering into the
ports of the United States."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>General John Armstrong, the American Minister
who preceded Barlow, never had heard of this decree;
it had not been transmitted to the French Minister
at Washington; it had not been made public in any
way. It was a ruse, declared the Federalists when
news of it reached America&mdash;a cheap and tawdry
trick to save Madison's face, a palpable falsehood, a
clumsy afterthought. So also asserted Robert Smith,
and so he wrote to the Chief Justice.</p>

<p>Marshall agreed with the fallen Baltimore politician.
Continuing his letter to Smith, the longest and
most unreserved he ever wrote, except to Washington
and to Lee when on the French Mission,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> the
Chief Justice said: "The view you take of the edict
purporting to bear date of the 28<sup>th&#803;</sup> of April 1811
appears to me to be perfectly correct ... I am astonished,
if in these times any thing ought to astonish,
that the same impression is not made on all." Marshall
puts many questions based on dates, for the
purpose of exposing the fraudulent nature of the
French decree and continues:</p>

<p>"Had France felt for the United States any portion
of that respect to which our real importance entitles
us, would she have failed to give this proof of it? But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
regardless of the assertion made by the President in
his Proclamation of the 2<sup>d&#803;</sup> of Nov<sup>r&#803;</sup> 1810, regardless
of the communications made by the Executive to the
Legislature, regardless of the acts of Congress, and
regardless of the propositions which we have invariably
maintained in our diplomatic intercourse
with Great Britain, the Emperor has given a date to
his decree, &amp; has assigned a motive for its enactment,
which in express terms contradict every assertion
made by the American nation throughout all the
departments of its government, &amp; remove the foundation
on which its whole system has been erected.</p>

<p>"The motive for this offensive &amp; contemptuous
proceeding cannot be to rescue himself from the imputation
of continuing to enforce his decrees after
their formal repeal because this imputation is precisely
as applicable to a repeal dated the 28<sup>th&#803;</sup> of
April 1811 as to one dated the 1<sup>st</sup> of November 1810,
since the execution of those decrees has continued
after the one date as well as after the other. Why
then is this obvious fabrication such as we find it?
Why has M<sup>r&#803;</sup> Barlow been unable to obtain a paper
which might consult the honor &amp; spare the feelings
of his government? The answer is not to be disguised.
Bonaparte does not sufficiently respect us
to exhibit for our sake, to France, to America, to
Britain, or to the world, any evidence of his having
receded one step from the position he had taken.</p>

<p>"He could not be prevailed on, even after we had
done all he required, to soften any one of his acts so
far as to give it the appearance of his having advanced
one step to meet us. That this step, or rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the appearance of having taken it, might save our
reputation was regarded as dust in the balance.
Even now, after our solemn &amp; repeated assertions
that our discrimination between the belligerents is
founded altogether on a first advance of France&mdash;on
a decisive &amp; unequivocal repeal of all her obnoxious
decrees; after we have engaged in a war of the most
calamitous character, avowedly, because France had
repealed those decrees, the Emperor scorns to countenance
the assertion or to leave it uncontradicted.</p>

<p>"He avers to ourselves, to our selected enemy, &amp;
to the world, that, whatever pretexts we may assign
for our conduct, he has in fact ceded nothing, he has
made no advance, he stands on his original ground &amp;
we have marched up to it. We have submitted, completely
submitted; &amp; he will not leave us the poor
consolation of concealing that submission from ourselves.
But not even our submission has obtained
relief. His cruizers still continue to capture, sink,
burn &amp; destroy.</p>

<p>"I cannot contemplate this subject without excessive
mortification as well at the contempt with
which we are treated as at the infatuation of my
countrymen. It is not however for me to indulge
these feelings though I cannot so entirely suppress
them as not sometimes though rarely to allow them
a place in a private letter." Marshall assures Smith
that he has "read with attention and approbation"
the paper sent him and will see to its "republication."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p><p>From reading Marshall's letter without a knowledge
of the facts, one could not possibly infer that
America ever had been wronged by the Power with
which we were then at war. All the strength of his
logical and analytical mind is brought to bear upon
the date and motives of Napoleon's last decree.
He wrote in the tone and style, and with the controversial
ability of his state papers, when at the head
of the Adams Cabinet. But had the British Foreign
Secretary guided his pen, his indictment of France
and America could not have been more unsparing.
His letter to Smith was a call to peace advocates
and British partisans to combine to end the war by
overthrowing the Administration.</p>

<p>This unfortunate letter was written during the
long period between the adjournment of the Supreme
Court in March, 1812, and its next session in February
of the following year. Marshall's sentiments
are in sharp contrast with those of Joseph Story,
whose letters, written from his Massachusetts home,
strongly condemn those who were openly opposing
the war. "The present," he writes, "was the last
occasion which patriotism ought to have sought to
create divisions."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>Apparently the Administration did not know of
Marshall's real feelings. Immediately after the declaration
of war, Monroe, who succeeded Smith as
Secretary of State, had sent his old personal friend,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the Chief Justice, some documents relating to the war.
If Marshall had been uninformed as to the causes
that drove the United States to take militant action,
these papers supplied that information. In acknowledging
receipt of them, he wrote Monroe:</p>

<p>"On my return to day from my farm where I
pass a considerable portion of my time in <i>laborious
relaxation</i>, I found a copy of the message of the
President of the 1<sup>st</sup> inst accompanied by the report
of the Committee of foreign relations &amp; the
declaration of war against Great Britain, under
cover from you.</p>

<p>"Permit me to subjoin to my thanks for this mark
of your attention my fervent wish that this momentous
measure may, in its operation on the interest
&amp; honor of our country, disappoint only its enemies.
Whether my prayer be heard or not I shall remain
with respectful esteem," etc.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Cold as this letter was, and capable as it was of
double interpretation, to the men sorely pressed
by the immediate exigencies of combat, it gave no
inkling that the Chief Justice of the United States
was at that very moment not only in close sympathy
with the peace party, but was actually encouraging
that party in its efforts to end the war.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Just at this time, Marshall must have longed for
seclusion, and, by a lucky chance, it was afforded
him. One of the earliest and most beneficial effects
of the Non-Importation, Embargo, and Non-Inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>course
laws that preceded the war, was the heavily
increased migration from the seaboard States to the
territories beyond the Alleghanies. The dramatic
story of Burr's adventures and designs had reached
every ear and had turned toward the Western country
the eyes of the poor, the adventurous, the aspiring;
already thousands of settlers were taking up
the new lands over the mountains. Thus came a
practical consideration of improved means of travel
and transportation. Fresh interest in the use of
waterways was given by Fulton's invention, which
seized upon the imagination of men. The possibilities
of steam navigation were in the minds of all who
observed the expansion of the country and the
growth of domestic commerce.</p>

<p>Before the outbreak of war, the Legislature of Virginia
passed an act appointing commissioners "for
the purpose of viewing certain rivers within this
Commonwealth,"<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and Marshall was made the head
of this body of investigators. Nothing could have
pleased him more. It was practical work on a matter
that interested him profoundly, and the renewal of
a subject which he had entertained since his young
manhood.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>This tour of observation promised to be full of va<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>riety
and adventure, tinged with danger, into forests,
over mountains, and along streams and rivers not
yet thoroughly explored. For a short time Marshall
would again live over the days of his boyhood.
Most inviting of all, he would get far away from
talk or thought of the detested war. Whether the
Presidential scheming in his behalf bore fruit or
withered, his absence in the wilderness was an ideal
preparation to meet either outcome.</p>

<p>In his fifty-seventh year Marshall set out at the
head of the expedition, and a thorough piece of work
he did. With chain and spirit level the route was
carefully surveyed from Lynchburg to the Ohio.
Sometimes progress was made slowly and with the
utmost labor. In places the scenes were "awful and
discouraging."</p>

<p>The elaborate report which the commission submitted
to the Legislature was written by Marshall.
It reads, says the surveyor of this division of the
Chesapeake and Ohio Railway,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> "as an account of
that survey of 1869, when I pulled a chain down the
rugged banks of New River." Practicable sections
were accurately pointed out and the methods by
which they could best be utilized were recommended
with particular care.</p>

<p>Marshall's report is alive with far-seeing and
statesmanlike suggestions. He thinks, in 1812, that
steamboats can be run successfully on the New River,
but fears that the expense will be too great. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
velocity of the current gives him some anxiety, but
"the currents of the Hudson, of the Mohawk, and
of the Mississippi, are very strong; and ... a practice
so entirely novel as the use of steam in navigation,
will probably receive great improvement."</p>

<p>The expense of the undertaking must, he says, depend
on the use to be made of the route. Should the
intention be only to assist the local traffic of the
"upper country down the James river," the expense
would not be great. But, "if the views of the legislature
shall extend to a free commercial intercourse
with the western states," the route must compete
with others then existing "or that may be opened."
In that case "no improvement ought to be undertaken
but with a determination to make it complete
and effectual." If this were done, the commerce of
Kentucky, Ohio, and even a part of Southwestern
Pennsylvania would pour through Virginia to the
Atlantic States. This was a rich prize which other
States were exerting themselves to capture. Moreover,
such "commercial intercourse" would bind
Virginia to the growing West by "strong ties" of
"friendly sentiments," and these were above price.
"In that mysterious future which is in reserve, and
is yet hidden from us, events may occur to render"
such a community of interest and mutual regard
"too valuable to be estimated in dollars and cents."</p>

<p>Marshall pictures the growth of the West, "that
extensive and fertile country ... increasing in wealth
and population with a rapidity which baffles calculation."
Not only would Virginia profit by opening
a great trade route to the West, but the Nation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
would be vastly benefited. "Every measure which
tends to cement more closely the union of the eastern
with the western states" would be invaluable to
the whole country. The military uses of "this central
channel of communication" were highly important:
"For the want of it, in the course of the last
autumn, government was reduced to the necessity of
transporting arms in waggons from Richmond to
the falls of the Great Kanawha," and "a similar
necessity may often occur."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>When Marshall returned to Richmond, he found
the country depressed and in turmoil. The war had
begun dismally for the Americans. Our want of
military equipment and training was incredible and
assured those disasters that quickly fell upon us.
The Federalist opposition to the war grew ever
bolder, ever more bitter. The Massachusetts House
of Representatives issued an "Address" to the people,
urging the organization of a "<i>peace party</i>," adjuring
"loud and deep ... disapprobation of this war,"
and demanding that nobody enlist in the army.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
Pamphlets were widely circulated, abusing the
American Government and upholding the British
cause. The ablest of these, "Mr. Madison's War,"
was by John Lowell of Boston.</p>

<p>The President, he said, "impelled" Congress to
declare an "offensive" war against Great Britain.
Madison was a member of "the <i>French</i> party."
British impressment was the pursuance of a sound
policy; the British doctrine&mdash;once a British subject,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
always a British subject&mdash;was unassailable. The
Orders in Council were just; the execution of them
"moderation" itself. On every point, in short, the
British Government was right; the French, diabolical;
the American, contemptible and wrong. How
trivial America's complaints, even if there was a
real basis for them, in view of Great Britain's unselfish
struggle against "the gigantic dominion of
France."</p>

<p>If that Power, "swayed" by that satanic genius,
Napoleon, should win, would she not take Nova
Scotia, Canada, Louisiana, the Antilles, Florida,
South America? After these conquests, would not
the United States, "the only remaining republic,"
be conquered. Most probably. What then ought
America to do?" In war offensive and unjust, the
citizens are not only obliged not to take part, but
by the laws of God, and of civil society, they are
bound to abstain." What were the rights of citizens
in war-time? To oppose the war by tongue and pen,
if they thought the war to be wrong, and to refuse to
serve if called "contrary to the Constitution."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Such was the Federalism of 1812-15, such the arguments
that would have been urged for the election
of Marshall had he been chosen as the peace candidate.
But the peace Republicans of New York
nominated the able, cunning, and politically corrupt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
De Witt Clinton; and this man, who had assured the
Federalists that he favored an "honourable peace"
with England,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> was endorsed by a Federalist caucus
as the anti-war standard-bearer,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> though not without
a swirl of acrimony and dissension.</p>

<p>But for the immense efforts of Clinton to secure
the nomination, and the desire of the Federalists and
all conservatives that Marshall should continue as
Chief Justice,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> it is possible that he might have been
named as the opponent of Madison in the Presidential
contest of 1812. "I am far enough from desiring
Clinton for President of the United States," wrote
Pickering in the preceding July; "I would infinitely
prefer another Virginian&mdash;if Judge Marshall could
be the man."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Marshall surely would have done better than Clinton,
who, however, carried New York, New Jersey,
Delaware, Maryland, and all the New England
States except Vermont. The mercantile classes
would have rallied to Marshall's standard more
enthusiastically than to Clinton's. The lawyers
generally would have worked hard for him. The
Federalists, who accepted Clinton with repugnance,
would have exerted themselves to the utmost for
Marshall, the ideal representative of Federalism. He
was personally very strong in North Carolina; the
capture of Pennsylvania might have been possible;<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
Vermont might have given him her votes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>The Federalist resistance to the war grew more determined
as the months wore on. Throughout New
England the men of wealth, nearly all of whom were
Federalists, declined to subscribe to the Government
loans.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The Governors of the New England
States refused to aid the National Government with
the militia.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> In Congress the Federalists were obstructing
war measures and embarrassing the Government
in every way their ingenuity could devise.
One method was to force the Administration to tell
the truth about Napoleon's pretended revocation of
his obnoxious decree. A resolution asking the President
to inform the House "when, by whom, and in
what manner, the first intelligence was given to this
Government" of the St. Cloud Decree, was offered
by Daniel Webster,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> who had been elected to Congress
from New Hampshire as the fiercest youthful
antagonist of the war in his State.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The Republicans
agreed, and Webster's resolution was passed by
a vote of 137 yeas to only 26 nays.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>In compliance the President transmitted a long report.
It was signed by the Secretary of State, James
Monroe, but bears the imprint of Madison's lucid
mind. The report states the facts upon which Congress
was compelled to declare war and demonstrates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
that the Decree of St. Cloud had nothing to do with
our militant action, since it was not received until
more than a month after our declaration of war.
Then follow several clear and brilliant paragraphs
setting forth the American view of the causes and
purposes of the war.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Timothy Pickering was not now in the Senate. The
Republican success in Massachusetts at the State
election of 1810 had given the Legislature to that
party,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> and the pugnacious Federalist leader was
left at home. There he raged and intrigued and wrote
reams of letters. Monroe's report lent new fury to
his always burning wrath, and he sent that document,
with his malediction upon it, to John Marshall at
Richmond. In reply the Chief Justice said that the
report "contains a labored apology for France but
none for ourselves. It furnishes no reason for our
tame unmurmuring acquiescence under the double
insult of withholding this paper [Decree of St. Cloud]
from us &amp; declaring in our face that it has been put
in our possession.</p>

<p>"The report is silent on another subject of still
deeper interest. It leaves unnoticed the fact that the
Berlin &amp; Milan decrees were certainly not repealed
by that insidious decree of April since it had never
been communicated to the French courts and cruizers,
&amp; since their cruizers had at a period subsequent
to the pretended date of that decree received orders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to continue to execute the offensive decrees on American
vessels.</p>

<p>"The report manifests no sensibility at the disgraceful
circumstances which tend strongly to prove
that this paper was fabricated to satisfy the importunities
of Mr. Barlow, was antedated to suit French
purposes; nor at the contempt manifested for the
feelings of Americans and their government, by not
deigning so to antedate it as to save the credit of our
Administration by giving some plausibility to their
assertion that the repeal had taken place on the 1<sup>st</sup>
of Nov<sup>r</sup>&mdash;But this is a subject with which I dare
not trust myself."</p>

<p>The plight of the American land forces, the splendid
and unrivaled victories of the American Navy, apparently
concerned Marshall not at all. His eyes
were turned toward Europe; his ears strained to
catch the sounds from foreign battle-fields.</p>

<p>"I look with anxious solicitude&mdash;with mingled
hope &amp; fear," he continues, "to the great events
which are taking place in the north of Germany.
It appears probable that a great battle will be
fought on or near the Elbe &amp; never had the world
more at stake than will probably depend on that
battle.</p>

<p>"Your opinions had led me to hope that there was
some prospect for a particular peace for ourselves.
My own judgement, could I trust it, would tell me
that peace or war will be determined by the events
in Europe."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<p>The "great battle" which Marshall foresaw had
been fought nearly eight weeks before his letter was
written. Napoleon had been crushingly defeated at
Leipzig in October, 1813, and the British, Prussian,
and other armies which Great Britain had combined
against him, were already invading France. When,
later, the news of this arrived in America, it was
hailed by the Federalists with extravagant rejoicings.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Secession, if the war were continued, now became
the purpose of the more determined Federalist leaders.
It was hopeless to keep up the struggle, they
said. The Administration had precipitated hostilities
without reason or right, without conscience or
sense.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The people never had favored this wretched
conflict; and now the tyrannical Government, failing
to secure volunteers, had resorted to conscription&mdash;an
"infamous" expedient resorted to in brutal violation
of the Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> So came the Hartford<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Convention which the cool wisdom of George Cabot
saved from proclaiming secession.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Of the two pretenses for war against Great Britain,
the Federalists alleged that one had been removed
even before we declared war, and that only the false
and shallow excuse of British impressment of American
seamen remained. Madison and Monroe recognized
this as the one great remaining issue, and an
Administration pamphlet was published asserting
the reason and justice of the American position.
This position was that men of every country have a
natural right to remove to another land and there
become citizens or subjects, entitled to the protection
of the government of the nation of their adoption.
The British principle, on the contrary, was that
British subjects could never thus expatriate themselves,
and that, if they did so, the British Government
could seize them wherever found, and by force
compel them to serve the Empire in any manner the
Government chose to direct.</p>

<p>Monroe's brother-in-law, George Hay, still the
United States Attorney for the District of Virginia,
was selected to write the exposition of the American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
view. It seems probable that his manuscript was
carefully revised by Madison and Monroe, and perhaps
by Jefferson.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Certainly Hay stated with singular
precision the views of the great Republican
triumvirate. The pamphlet was entitled "A Treatise
on Expatriation." He began: "I hold in utter
reprobation the idea that a man is bound by an obligation,
permanent and unalterable, to the government
of a country which he has abandoned and his
allegiance to which he has solemnly adjured."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Immediately John Lowell answered.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Nothing
keener and more spirited ever came from the pen of
that gifted man. "The presidential pamphleteer," as
Lowell called Hay, ignored the law. The maxim,
once a subject always a subject, was as true of
America as of Britain. Had not Ellsworth, when
Chief Justice, so decided in the famous case of Isaac
Williams?<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Yet Hay sneered at the opinion of that
distinguished jurist.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Pickering joyfully dispatched Lowell's brochure to
Marshall, who lost not a moment in writing of his
admiration. "I had yesterday the pleasure of receiv<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>ing
your letter of the 8th accompanying M<sup>r</sup> Lowell's
very masterly review of the treatise on expatriation.
I have read it with great pleasure, &amp; thank you very
sincerely for this mark of your recollection.</p>

<p>"Could I have ever entertained doubts on the subject,
this review would certainly have removed them.
Mingled with much pungent raillery is a solidity of
argument and an array of authority which in my
judgement is entirely conclusive. But in truth it is
a question upon which I never entertained a scintilla
of doubt; and have never yet heard an argument
which ought to excite a doubt in any sound and reflecting
mind. It will be to every thinking American
a most afflicting circumstance, should our government
on a principle so completely rejected by the
world proceed to the execution of unfortunate, of
honorable, and of innocent men."<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Astonishing and repellent as these words now
appear, they expressed the views of every Federalist
lawyer in America. The doctrine of perpetual allegiance
was indeed then held and practiced by every
government except our own,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> nor was it rejected by
the United States until the Administration became
Republican. Marshall, announcing the opinion of
the Supreme Court in 1804, had held that an alien
could take lands in New Jersey because he had lived
in that State when, in 1776, the Legislature passed
a law making all residents citizens.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Thus he had
declared that an American citizen did not cease to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
such because he had become the subject of a foreign
power. Four years later, in another opinion involving
expatriation, he had stated the law to be that a
British subject, born in England before 1775, could
not take, by devise, lands in Maryland, the statute
of that State forbidding aliens from thus acquiring
property there.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> In both these cases, however, Marshall
refrained from expressly declaring in terms
against the American doctrine.</p>

<p>Even as late as 1821 the Chief Justice undoubtedly
retained his opinion that the right of expatriation
did not exist,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> although he did not say so in express
terms. But in Marshall's letter on Lowell's pamphlet
he flatly avows his belief in the principle of perpetual
allegiance, any direct expression on which he so
carefully avoided when deciding cases involving it.</p>

<p>Thus the record shows that John Marshall was as
bitterly opposed to the War of 1812 as was Pickering
or Otis or Lowell. So entirely had he become one of
"the aristocracy of talents of reputation, &amp; of property,"
as Plumer, in 1804, had so accurately styled
the class of which he himself was then a member,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
that Marshall looked upon all but one subject then
before the people with the eyes of confirmed reaction.
That subject was Nationalism. To that supreme
cause he was devoted with all the passion
of his deep and powerful nature; and in the service
of that cause he was soon to do much more than he
had already performed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Our second war with Great Britain accomplished
none of the tangible and immediate objects for which
it was fought. The British refused to abandon "the
right" of impressment; or to disclaim the British
sovereignty of the oceans whenever they chose to
assert it; or to pay a farthing for their spoliation of
American commerce. On the other hand, the British
did not secure one of their demands.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The peace
treaty did little more than to end hostilities.</p>

<p>But the war achieved an inestimable good&mdash;it de-Europeanized
America. It put an end to our thinking
and feeling only in European terms and emotions.
It developed the spirit of the new America, born
since our political independence had been achieved,
and now for the first time emancipated from the intellectual
and spiritual sovereignty of the Old World.
It had revealed to this purely American generation
a consciousness of its own strength; it could exult in
the fact that at last America had dared to fight.</p>

<p>The American Navy, ship for ship, officer for officer,
man for man, had proved itself superior to
the British Navy, the very name of which had hitherto
been mentioned only in terror or admiration
of its unconquerable might. In the end, raw and
untrained American troops had beaten British regulars.
American riflemen of the West and South had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
overwhelmed the flower of all the armies of Europe.
An American frontier officer, Andrew Jackson, had
easily outwitted some of Great Britain's ablest and
most experienced professional generals. In short,
on land and sea America had stood up to, had really
beaten, the tremendous Power that had overthrown
the mighty Napoleon.</p>

<p>Such were the feelings and thoughts of that Young
America which had come into being since John Marshall
had put aside his Revolutionary uniform and
arms. And in terms very much like those of the
foregoing paragraph the American people generally
expressed their sentiments.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Embargo, the Non-Intercourse and
Non-Importation Acts, the British blockades, the
war itself, had revolutionized the country economically
and socially. American manufacturing was
firmly established. Land travel and land traffic
grew to proportions never before imagined, never
before desired. The people of distant sections became
acquainted.</p>

<p>The eyes of all Americans, except those of the aged
or ageing, were turned from across the Atlantic Ocean
toward the boundless, the alluring West&mdash;their
thoughts diverted from the commotions of Europe
and the historic antagonism of foreign nations, to the
economic conquest of a limitless and virgin empire
and to the development of incalculable and untouched
resources, all American and all their own.</p>

<p>The migration to the West, which had been increasing
for years, now became almost a folk movement.
The Eastern States were drained of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
young men and women. Some towns were almost
depopulated.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> And these hosts of settlers carried into
wilderness and prairie a spirit and pride that had not
been seen or felt in America since the time of the
Revolution. But their high hopes were to be quickly
turned into despair, their pride into ashes; for a
condition was speedily to develop that would engulf
them in disaster. It was this situation which was to
call forth some of the greatest of Marshall's Constitutional
opinions. This forbidding future, however,
was foreseen by none of that vast throng of home-seekers
crowding every route to the "Western Country,"
in the year of 1815. Only the rosiest dreams
were theirs and the spirited consciousness that they
were Americans, able to accomplish all things, even
the impossible.</p>

<p>It was then a new world in which John Marshall
found himself, when, in his sixtieth year, the war
which he so abhorred came to an end. A state of
things surrounded him little to his liking and yet
soon to force from him the exercise of the noblest judicial
statesmanship in American history. From the
extreme independence of this new period, the intense
and sudden Nationalism of the war, the ideas of local
sovereignty rekindled by the New England Federalists
at the dying fires that Jefferson and the Republicans
had lighted in 1798, and from the play of
conflicting interests came a reaction against Nationalism
which it was Marshall's high mission to check
and to turn into channels of National power, National
safety, and National well-being.</p>

"The only mode by which either of them [the European belligerents]

Jefferson tenaciously clung to his prejudice against Great Britain:
"The object of England, long obvious, is to claim the ocean as her
domain.... We believe no more in Bonaparte's fighting merely for the
liberty of the seas, than in Great Britain's fighting for the liberties of
mankind." (Jefferson to Maury, April 25, 1812, <i>ib.</i> <span class="smcap">xi</span>, 240-41.) He
never failed to accentuate his love for France and his hatred for
Napoleon.</p></div>

Joseph Hopkinson sarcastically wrote: "Bless the Embargo&mdash;thrice
bless the Presidents distribution Proclamation, by which his
minions are to judge of the appetites of his subjects, how much food
they may reasonably consume, and who shall supply them ... whether
under the Proclamation and Embargo System, a child may be lawfully

The intensity of the interest in the Embargo is illustrated by Giles's
statement in his reply to Hillhouse that it "almost ... banish[ed] every
other topic of conversation." (<i>Ib.</i> 94.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_45_45" id="Footnote_45_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> Four years earlier, Pickering had plotted the secession of New
England and enlisted the support of the British Minister to accomplish
it. (See vol. <span class="smcap">iii</span>, chap. <span class="smcap">vii</span>, of this work.) His wife was an
Englishwoman, the daughter of an officer of the British Navy.

Consul-General at London under the Federalist Administrations and
was at this time a merchant in that city. (Pickering to Rose, March
22, 1808, <i>New-England Federalism:</i> Adams, 370.) Pickering had been,
and still was, carrying on with George Rose, recently British Minister
to the United States, a correspondence all but treasonable. (Morison:

The Federalist view was that the "Force Act" and other extreme
portions of the Embargo laws were "so violently and palpably unconstitutional,
as to render a reference to the judiciary absurd"; and
that it was "the inherent right of the people to resist measures
fundamentally inconsistent with the principles of just liberty and the
Social compact." (Hare to Otis, Feb. 10, 1814, Morison: <i>Otis</i>, <span class="smcap">ii</span>,

1809, proposing an amendment to the National Constitution for the
establishment of an "impartial tribunal" to decide upon controversies
between States and the Nation. (<i>State Documents on Federal
Relations</i>: Ames, 46-48.) In reply Virginia insisted that the Supreme
Court, "selected from those ... who are most celebrated for virtue and
legal learning," was the proper tribunal to decide such cases. (<i>Ib.</i>
49-50.) This Nationalist position Virginia reversed within a decade in
protest against Marshall's Nationalist opinions. Virginia's Nationalist

a separate government under the support of Great Britain, may

against Great Britain, drew venomous abuse of the whole British
nation: "What is to restore order and safety on the ocean?" he wrote;
"the death of George III? Not at all. He is only stupid;... his ministers ... ephemeral.
But his nation is permanent, and it is that which
is the tyrant of the ocean. The principle that force is right, is become
the principle of the nation itself. They would not permit an
honest minister, were accident to bring such an one into power, to
relax their system of lawless piracy." (Jefferson to Rodney, Feb. 10,

Professor Channing thus states the American grievances: "Inciting
the Indians to rebellion, impressing American seamen and making
them serve on British war-ships, closing the ports of Europe to
American commerce, these were the counts in the indictment against
the people and government of Great Britain." (Channing: <i>Jeff.

"The United States," says Henry Adams, "had a superfluity of
only too good causes for war with Great Britain." (Adams: <i>Life
of Albert Gallatin</i>, 445.) Adams emphasizes this: "The United States
had the right to make war on England with or without notice, either
for her past spoliations, her actual blockades, her Orders in Council
other than blockades, her Rule of 1756, her impressments, or her
attack on the 'Chesapeake,' not yet redressed,&mdash;possibly also for
other reasons less notorious." (Adams: <i>U.S.</i> <span class="smcap">v</span>, 339.) And see Roosevelt,

enabled to carry on their purposes almost without check." (Same to
same, May 27, 1813, <i>ib.</i> 244.) Story was lamenting that the National
courts had no common-law jurisdiction. Some months earlier he
had implored Nathaniel Williams, Representative in Congress from
Story's district, to "induce Congress to give the Judicial Courts of

Do not suffer conspiracies to destroy the Union." (Same

November 7, 1811.
</p><p>
While the identity of Stoddert's agent cannot be established with
certainty, he probably was one John Davis of Salisbury, England,
as described in the text. "Jo" was then used for John as much as
for Joseph; and Davis was frequently spelled "Davies." A John or
"Jo" Davis or Davies, an Englishman, was a very busy person in
America during the first decade of the nineteenth century. (See
Loshe: <i>Early American Novel</i>, 74-77.) Naturally he would have
been against the War of 1812, and he was just the sort of person that
an impracticable man like Stoddert would have chosen for such a
mission.</p></div>

A single quotation from the letters of Southern Federalists will
show how accurately Marshall interpreted Federalist feeling during
the War of 1812: "Heaven grant that ... our own Country may not
be found ultimately, a solitary friend of this great Robber of Nations."
(Tallmadge to McHenry, May 30, 1813, Steiner, 598.) The war had

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_141_141" id="Footnote_141_141"></a><a href="#FNanchor_141_141"><span class="label">[141]</span></a> The Federalists frantically opposed conscription. Daniel Webster,
especially, denounced it. "Is this [conscription] ... consistent
with the character of a free Government?... No, Sir.... The Constitution
is libelled, foully libelled. The people of this country have
not established ... such a fabric of despotism....
</p><p>
"Where is it written in the Constitution ... that you may take
children from their parents ... &amp; compel them to fight the battles of
any war, in which the folly or the wickedness of Government may
engage it?... Such an abominable doctrine has no foundation in the
Constitution."
</p><p>
Conscription, Webster said, was a gambling device to throw the
dice for blood; and it was a "horrible lottery." "May God, in his
compassion, shield me from ... the enormity of this guilt." (See
Webster's speech on the Conscription Bill delivered in the House of
Representatives, December 9, 1814, Van Tyne, 56-68; see also
Curtis: <i>Life of Daniel Webster</i>, <span class="smcap">i</span>, 138.)
</p><p>
Webster had foretold what he meant to do: "Of course we shall
oppose such usurpation." (Webster to his brother, Oct. 30, 1814,
Van Tyne, 54.) Again: "The conscription has not come up&mdash;if it
does it will cause a storm such as was never witnessed here" [in
Washington]. (Same to same, Nov. 29, 1814, <i>ib.</i> 55.)</p></div>

the same subject. For example: "I hold the right of expatriation to
be inherent in every man by the laws of nature, and incapable of
being rightfully taken from him even by the united will of every
other person in the nation." (Jefferson to Gallatin, June 26, 1806,
<i>Works</i>: Ford, <span class="smcap">x</span>, 273.) Again: "Our particular and separate grievance
is only the impressment of our citizens. We must sacrifice the
last dollar and drop of blood to rid us of that badge of slavery."
(Jefferson to Crawford, Feb. 11, 1815, <i>ib.</i> <span class="smcap">xi</span>, 450-51.) This letter was

Washington.</p></div>

<h3>MARSHALL AND STORY</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Either the office was made for the man or the man for the office.    (George S. Hillard.)</p>

<p>I am in love with his character, positively in love.   (Joseph Story.)</p>

<p>In the midst of these gay circles my mind is carried to my own fireside and to
my beloved wife.   (Marshall.)</p>

<p>Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the
face of the earth.   (Numbers <span class="smcap">xii</span>, 3.)</p></div>


<p>"It will be difficult to find a character of firmness
enough to preserve his independence on the same
bench with Marshall."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> So wrote Thomas Jefferson
one year after he had ceased to be President. He was
counseling Madison as to the vacancy on the Supreme
Bench and one on the district bench at Richmond,
in filling both of which he was, for personal
reasons, feverishly concerned.</p>

<p>We are now to ascend with Marshall the mountain
peaks of his career. Within the decade that followed
after the close of our second war with Great Britain,
he performed nearly all of that vast and creative
labor, the lasting results of which have given him
that distinctive title, the Great Chief Justice. During
that period he did more than any other one man
ever has done to vitalize the American Constitution;
and, in the performance of that task, his influence
over his associates was unparalleled.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>When Justices Chase and Cushing died and their
successors Gabriel Duval<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and Joseph Story were
appointed, the majority of the Supreme Court, for
the first time, became Republican. Yet Marshall
continued to dominate it as fully as when its members
were of his own political faith and views of government.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
In the whole history of courts there is no
parallel to such supremacy. Not without reason was
that tribunal looked upon and called "Marshall's
Court." It is interesting to search for the sources
of his strange power.</p>

<p>These sources are not to be found exclusively in the
strength of Marshall's intellect, surpassing though
it was, nor yet in the mere dominance of his will.
Joseph Story was not greatly inferior to Marshall in
mind and far above him in accomplishments, while
William Johnson, the first Justice of the Supreme
Court appointed by Jefferson, was as determined as
Marshall and was "strongly imbued with the principles
of southern democracy, bold, independent,
eccentric, and sometimes harsh."<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Nor did learning
give Marshall his commanding influence. John Jay
and Oliver Ellsworth were his superiors in that respect;
while Story so infinitely surpassed him in erudition
that, between the two men, there is nothing
but contrast. Indeed, Marshall had no "learning"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
at all in the academic sense;<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> we must seek elsewhere
for an explanation of his peculiar influence.</p>

<p>This explanation is, in great part, furnished by
Marshall's personality. The manner of man he was,
of course, is best revealed by the well-authenticated
accounts of his daily life. He spent most of his time
at Richmond, for the Supreme Court sat in Washington
only a few weeks each year. He held circuit
court at Raleigh as well as at the Virginia Capital,
but the sessions seldom occupied more than a fortnight
each. In Richmond, then, his characteristics
were best known; and so striking were they that
time has but little dimmed the memory of them.</p>

<p>Marshall, the Chief Justice, continued to neglect his
dress and personal appearance as much as he did
when, as a lawyer, his shabby attire so often "brought
a blush" to the cheeks of his wife,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> and his manners
were as "lax and lounging" as when Jefferson called
them proofs of a "profound hypocrisy."<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Although
no man in America was less democratic in his ideas
of government, none was more democratic in his
contact with other people. To this easy bonhomie
was added a sense of humor, always quick to appreciate
an amusing situation.</p>

<p>When in Richmond, Marshall often did his own
marketing and carried home the purchases he made.
The tall, ungainly, negligently clad Chief Justice,
ambling along the street, his arms laden with pur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>chases,
was a familiar sight.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> He never would hurry,
and habitually lingered at the market-place, chatting
with everybody, learning the gossip of the town,
listening to the political talk that in Richmond never
ceased, and no doubt thus catching at first hand the
drift of public sentiment.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The humblest and poorest
man in Virginia was not more unpretentious than
John Marshall.</p>

<p>No wag was more eager for a joke. One day, as he
loitered on the outskirts of the market, a newcomer
in Richmond, who had never seen Marshall, offered
him a small coin to carry home for him a turkey just
purchased. Marshall accepted, and, with the bird
under his arm, trudged behind his employer. The incident
sent the city into gales of laughter, and was so
in keeping with Marshall's ways that it has been retold
from one generation to another, and is to-day
almost as much alive as ever.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> At another time the
Chief Justice was taken for the butcher. He called
on a relative's wife who had never met him, and
who had not been told of his plain dress and rustic
manners. Her husband wished to sell a calf and she
expected the butcher to call to make the trade. She
saw Marshall approaching, and judging by his appearance
that he was the butcher, she directed the
servant to tell him to go to the stable where the animal
was awaiting inspection.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>It was Marshall's custom to go early every morning
to a farm which he owned four miles from Richmond.
For the exercise he usually walked, but, when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
wished to take something heavy, he would ride. A
stranger coming upon him on the road would have
thought him one of the poorer small planters of the
vicinity. He was extremely fond of children and, if
he met one trudging along the road, he would take
the child up on the horse and carry it to its destination.
Often he was seen riding into Richmond from his
farm, with one child before and another behind him.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>Bishop Meade met Marshall on one of these morning
trips, carrying on horseback a bag of clover seed.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
On another, he was seen holding on the pommel a jug
of whiskey which he was taking out to his farmhands.
The cork had come out and he was using his
thumb as a stopper.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> He was keenly interested in
farming, and in 1811 was elected President of the
Richmond Society for Promotion of Agriculture.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>The distance from Richmond to Raleigh was, by
road, more than one hundred and seventy miles.
Except when he went by stage,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> as he seldom did, it
must have taken a week to make this journey. He
traveled in a primitive vehicle called a stick gig,
drawn by one horse which he drove himself, seldom
taking a servant with him.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Making his slow way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
through the immense stretches of tar pines and sandy
fields, the Chief Justice doubtless thought out the
solution of the problems before him and the plain,
clear, large statements of his conclusions which, from
the bench later, announced not only the law of particular
cases, but fundamental policies of the Nation.
His surroundings at every stage of the trip encouraged
just such reflection&mdash;the vast stillness, the deep
forests, the long hours, broken only by some accident
to gig or harness, or interrupted for a short time to
feed and rest his horse, and to eat his simple meal.</p>

<p>During these trips, Marshall would become so
abstracted that, apparently, he would forget where
he was driving. Once, when near the plantation of
Nathaniel Macon in North Carolina, he drove over
a sapling which became wedged between a wheel
and the shaft. One of Macon's slaves, working in
an adjacent field, saw the predicament, hurried to
his assistance, held down the sapling with one hand,
and with the other backed the horse until the gig
was free. Marshall tossed the negro a piece of
money and asked him who was his owner. "Marse
Nat. Macon," said the slave. "He is an old friend,"
said Marshall; "tell him how you have helped me,"
giving his name. When the negro told his master,
Macon said: "That was the great Chief Justice
Marshall, the biggest lawyer in the United States."
The slave grinned and answered: "Marse Nat., he
may be de bigges' lawyer in de United States, but he
ain't got sense enough to back a gig off a saplin'."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>At night he would stop at some log tavern on the
route, eat with the family and other guests, if any
were present, and sit before the fireplace after the
meal, talking with all and listening to all like the
simple and humble countryman he appeared to be.
Since the minor part of his time was spent in court,
and most of it about Richmond, or on the road to and
from Raleigh, or journeying to his Fauquier County
plantation and the beloved mountains of his youth
where he spent the hottest part of each year, it is
doubtful whether any other judge ever maintained
such intimate contact with people in the ordinary
walks of life as did John Marshall.</p>

<p>The Chief Justice always arrived at Raleigh stained
and battered from travel.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> The town had a population
of from three hundred to five hundred.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> He was
wont to stop at a tavern kept by a man named Cooke
and noted for its want of comfort; but, although the
inn got worse year after year, he still frequented it.
Early one morning an acquaintance saw the Chief
Justice go to the woodpile, gather an armful of wood
and return with it to the house. When they met
later in the day, the occurrence was recalled. "Yes,"
said Marshall, "I suppose it is not convenient for
Mr. Cooke to keep a servant, so I make up my own
fires."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>The Chief Justice occupied a small room in which
were the following articles: "A bed, ... two split-bot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>tom
chairs, a pine table covered with grease and ink,
a cracked pitcher and broken bowl." The host ate
with his guests and used his fingers instead of fork or
knife.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> When court adjourned for the day, Marshall
would play quoits in the street before the tavern
"with the public street characters of Raleigh," who
were lovers of the game.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>He was immensely popular in Raleigh, his familiar
manners and the justice of his decisions appealing
with equal force to the bar and people alike. Writing
at the time of the hearing of the Granville case,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
John Haywood, then State Treasurer of North
Carolina, testifies: "Judge Marshall ... is greatly respected
here, as well on account of his talents and
uprightness as for that sociability and ease of manner
which render all happy and pleased when in his
company."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>In spite of his sociability, which tempted him,
while in Richmond, to visit taverns and the law
offices of his friends, Marshall spent most of the day
in his house or in the big yard adjoining it, for Mrs.
Marshall's affliction increased with time, and the
Chief Justice, whose affection for his wife grew as
her illness advanced, kept near her as much as possi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>ble.
In Marshall's grounds and near his house were
several great oak and elm trees, beneath which was
a spring; to this spot he would take the papers in
cases he had to decide and, sitting on a rustic bench
under the shade, would write many of those great
opinions that have immortalized his name.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall's malady was largely a disease of
the nervous system and, at times, it seemingly
affected her mind. It was a common thing for the
Chief Justice to get up at any hour of the night and,
without putting on his shoes lest his footfalls might
further excite his wife, steal downstairs and drive
away for blocks some wandering animal&mdash;a cow,
a pig, a horse&mdash;whose sounds had annoyed her.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
Even upon entering his house during the daytime,
Marshall would take off his shoes and put on soft
slippers in the hall.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>She was, of course, unequal to the management of
the household. When the domestic arrangements
needed overhauling, Marshall would induce her to
take a long drive with her sister, Mrs. Edward Carrington,
or her daughter, Mrs. Jacquelin B. Harvie,
over the still and shaded roads of Richmond. The
carriage out of sight, he would throw off his coat and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
vest, roll up his shirt-sleeves, twist a bandanna handkerchief
about his head, and gathering the servants,
lead as well as direct them in dusting the walls and
furniture, scrubbing the floors and setting the house
in order.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>Numerous incidents of this kind are well authenticated.
To this day Marshall's unselfish devotion to
his infirm and distracted wife is recalled in Richmond.
But nobody ever heard the slightest word of
complaint from him; nor did any act or expression
of countenance so much as indicate impatience.</p>

<p>In his letters Marshall never fails to admonish his
wife, who seldom if ever wrote to him, to care for
her health. "Yesterday I received Jacquelin's letter
of the 12<sup>th</sup> informing me that your health was at
present much the same as when I left Richmond,"
writes Marshall.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> "John [Marshall's son] passed
through this city a day or two past, &amp; although I
did not see him I had the pleasure of hearing from
Mr. Washington who saw him ... that you were as
well as usual."<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> In another letter Marshall says:
"Do my dearest Polly let me hear from you through
someone of those who will be willing to write for
you."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Again he says: "I am most anxious to know
how you do but no body is kind enough to gratify
my wishes.... I looked eagerly for a letter to day
but no letter came.... You must not fail when you
go to Chiccahominy [Marshall's farm near Richmond]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
... to carry out blankets enough to keep you comfortable.
I am very desirous of hearing what is doing
there but as no body is good enough to let me know
how you do &amp; what is passing at home I could not
expect to hear what is passing at the farm."<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Indeed,
only one letter of Marshall's has been discovered
which indicates that he had received so much as a
line from his wife; and this was when, an old man of
seventy-five, he was desperately ill in Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
Nothing, perhaps, better reveals the sweetness of his
nature than his cheerful temper and tender devotion
under trying domestic conditions.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>His "dearest Polly" was intensely religious, and
Marshall profoundly respected this element of her
character.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The evidence as to his own views and
feelings on the subject of religion, although scanty,
is definite. He was a Unitarian in belief and therefore
never became a member of the Episcopal church,
to which his parents, wife, children, and all other relatives
belonged. But he attended services, Bishop
Meade informs us, not only because "he was a sincere
friend of religion," but also because he wished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
"to set an example." The Bishop bears this testimony:
"I can never forget how he would prostrate
his tall form before the rude low benches, without
backs, at Coolspring Meeting-House,<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> in the midst
of his children and grandchildren and his old neighbors."
When in Richmond, Marshall attended the
Monumental Church where, says Bishop Meade, "he
was much incommoded by the narrowness of the
pews.... Not finding room enough for his whole body
within the pew, he used to take his seat nearest the
door of the pew, and, throwing it open, let his legs
stretch a little into the aisle."<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>It is said, however, that his daughter, during her
last illness, declared that her father late in life was
converted, by reading Keith on Prophecy, to a belief
in the divinity of Christ; and that he determined
to "apply for admission to the communion of
our Church ... but died without ever communing."<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
There is, too, a legend about an astonishing flash of
eloquence from Marshall&mdash;"a streak of vivid lightning"&mdash;at
a tavern, on the subject of religion.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
The impression said to have been made by Marshall
on this occasion was heightened by his appearance
when he arrived at the inn. The shafts of his ancient
gig were broken and "held together by withes formed
from the bark of a hickory sapling"; he was negligently
dressed, his knee buckles loosened.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>In the tavern a discussion arose among some young
men concerning "the merits of the Christian reli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>gion."
The debate grew warm and lasted "from six
o'clock until eleven." No one knew Marshall, who
sat quietly listening. Finally one of the youthful combatants
turned to him and said: "Well, my old gentleman,
what think you of these things?" Marshall
responded with a "most eloquent and unanswerable
appeal." He talked for an hour, answering "every
argument urged against" the teachings of Jesus. "In
the whole lecture there was so much simplicity and
energy, pathos and sublimity, that not another word
was uttered." The listeners wondered who the old
man could be. Some thought him a preacher; and
great was their surprise when they learned afterwards
that he was the Chief Justice of the United
States.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>His devotion to his wife illustrates his attitude
toward women in general, which was one of exalted
reverence and admiration. "He was an enthusiast
in regard to the domestic virtues," testifies Story.
"There was ... a romantic chivalry in his feelings,
which, though rarely displayed, except in the circle
of his most intimate friends, would there pour out
itself with the most touching tenderness." He loved
to dwell on the "excellences," "accomplishments,"
"talents," and "virtues" of women, whom he looked
upon as "the friends, the companions, and the
equals of man." He tolerated no wit at their expense,
no fling, no sarcasm, no reproach. On no
phase of Marshall's character does Story place so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
much emphasis as on his esteem for women.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Harriet
Martineau, too, bears witness that "he maintained
through life and carried to his grave, a reverence
for woman as rare in its kind as in its degree."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
"I have always believed that national character as
well as happiness depends more on the female part
of society than is generally imagined," writes Marshall
in his ripe age to Thomas White.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>Commenting on Story's account, in his centennial
oration on the first settlement of Salem, of the death
of Lady Arbella Johnson, Marshall expresses his
opinion of women thus: "I almost envy the occasion
her sufferings and premature death have furnished
for bestowing that well-merited eulogy on a sex
which so far surpasses ours in all the amiable and
attractive virtues of the heart,&mdash;in all those qualities
which make up the sum of human happiness and
transform the domestic fireside into an elysium. I
read the passage to my wife who expressed such animated
approbation of it as almost to excite fears for
that exclusive admiration which husbands claim as
their peculiar privilege. Present my compliments to
M<sup>rs</sup> Story and say for me that a lady receives the
highest compliment her husband can pay her when
he expresses an exalted opinion of the sex, because
the world will believe that it is formed on the model
he sees at home."<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Ten children were born to John Marshall and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Mary Ambler, of whom six survived, five boys and
one girl.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> By 1815 only three of these remained at
home; Jacquelin, twenty-eight years old, James
Keith, fifteen, and Edward, ten years of age. John
was in Harvard, where Marshall sent all his sons
except Thomas, the eldest, who went to Princeton.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
The daughter, Mary, Marshall's favorite child, had
married Jacquelin B. Harvie and lived in Richmond
not far from Marshall's house.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Four other children
had died early.</p>

<p>"You ask," Marshall writes Story, "if M<sup>rs</sup> Marshall
and myself have ever lost a child. We have
lost four, three of them bidding fairer for health
and life than any that have survived them. One, a
daughter about six or seven ... was one of the most
fascinating children I ever saw. She was followed
within a fortnight by a brother whose death was attended
by a circumstance we can never forget.</p>

<p>"When the child was supposed to be dying I tore
the distracted mother from the bedside. We soon
afterwards heard a voice in the room which we considered
as indicating the death of the infant. We
believed him to be dead. [I went] into the room and
found him still breathing. I returned [and] as the
pang of his death had been felt by his mother and
[I] was confident he must die, I concealed his being
alive and prevailed on her to take refuge with her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
mother who lived the next door across an open
square from her.</p>

<p>"The child lived two days, during which I was
agonized with its condition and with the occasional
hope, though the case was desperate, that I might
enrapture his mother with the intelligence of his
restoration to us. After the event had taken place
his mother could not bear to return to the house she
had left and remained with her mother a fortnight.</p>

<p>"I then addressed to her a letter in verse in which
our mutual loss was deplored, our lost children
spoken of with the parental feeling which belonged
to the occasion, her affection for those which survived
was appealed to, and her religious confidence
in the wisdom and goodness of Providence excited.
The letter closed with a pressing invitation to return
to me and her children."<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>All of Marshall's sons married, settled on various
parts of the Fairfax estate, and lived as country
gentlemen. Thomas was given the old homestead at
Oak Hill, and there the Chief Justice built for his
eldest son the large house adjacent to the old one
where he himself had spent a year before joining the
army under Washington.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> To this spot Marshall
went every year, visiting Thomas and his other sons
who lived not far apart, seeing old friends, wandering
along Goose Creek, over the mountains, and
among the haunts where his first years were spent.</p>

<p>Here, of course, he was, in bearing and appearance,
even less the head of the Nation's Judiciary than he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
was in Richmond or on the road to Raleigh. He was
emphatically one of the people among whom he sojourned,
familiar, interested, considerate, kindly and
sociable to the last degree. Not one of his sons but
showed more consciousness of his own importance
than did John Marshall; not a planter of Fauquier,
Warren, and Shenandoah Counties, no matter how
poorly circumstanced, looked and acted less a Chief
Justice of the United States. These characteristics,
together with a peculiar generosity, made Marshall
the most beloved man in Northern Virginia.</p>

<p>Once, when going from Richmond to Fauquier
County, he overtook one of his Revolutionary comrades.
As the two rode on together, talking of their
war-time experiences and of their present circumstances,
it came out that this now ageing friend of
his youth was deeply in debt and about to lose all
his possessions. There was, it appeared, a mortgage
on his farm which would soon be foreclosed. After
the Chief Justice had left the inn where they both
had stopped for refreshments, an envelope was
handed to his friend containing Marshall's check for
the amount of the debt. His old comrade-in-arms
quickly mounted his horse, overtook Marshall, and
insisted upon returning the check. Marshall refused
to take it back, and the two friends argued the matter,
which was finally compromised by Marshall's
agreeing to take a lien upon the land. But this he
never foreclosed.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>This anecdote is highly characteristic of Marshall.
He was infinitely kind, infinitely considerate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Bishop Meade, who knew him well, says that he
"was a most conscientious man in regard to some
things which others might regard as too trivial to
be observed." On one of Meade's frequent journeys
with Marshall between Fauquier County and the
"lower country," they came to an impassable
stretch of road. Other travelers had taken down a
fence and gone through the adjoining plantation,
and the Bishop was about to follow the same
route. Marshall refused&mdash;"He said we had better
go around, although each step was a plunge, adding
that it was his duty, as one in office, to be very particular
in regard to such things."<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>When in Richmond the one sport in which he delighted
was the pitching of quoits. Not when a lawyer
was he a more enthusiastic or regular attendant
of the meetings of the Quoit Club, or Barbecue Club,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
under the trees at Buchanan's Spring on the outskirts
of Richmond, than he was when at the height
of his fame as Chief Justice of the United States.
More personal descriptions of Marshall at these
gatherings have come down to us than exist for any
other phase of his life. Chester Harding, the artist,
when painting Marshall's portrait during the summer
of 1826, spent some time in the Virginia Capital, and
attended one of the meetings of the Quoit Club. It
was a warm day, and presently Marshall, then in
his seventy-second year, was seen coming, his coat
on his arm, fanning himself with his hat. Walking
straight up to a bowl of mint julep, he poured a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
tumbler full of the liquid, drank it off, said, "How
are you, gentlemen?" and fell to pitching quoits with
immense enthusiasm. When he won, says Harding,
"the woods would ring with his triumphant
shout."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>James K. Paulding went to Richmond for the
purpose of talking to the Chief Justice and observing
his daily life. He was more impressed by Marshall's
gayety and unrestraint at the Quoit Club
than by anything else he noted. "The Chief-Justice
threw off his coat," relates Paulding, "and fell to work
with as much energy as he would have directed to
the decision of ... the conflicting jurisdiction of the
General and State Governments." During the game
a dispute arose between two players "as to the quoit
nearest the meg." Marshall was agreed upon as umpire.
"The Judge bent down on one knee and with
a straw essayed the decision of this important question,
... frequently biting off the end of the straw"
for greater accuracy.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The morning play over, the club dinner followed.
A fat pig, roasted over a pit of coals, cold meats,
melons, fruits, and vegetables, were served in the old
Virginia style. The usual drinks were porter, toddy,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
and the club punch made of "lemons, brandy, rum,
madeira, poured into a bowl one-third filled with ice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
(no water), and sweetened."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> In addition, champagne
and other wines were sometimes provided.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
At these meals none of the witty company equaled
Marshall in fun-making; no laugh was so cheery and
loud as his. Not more was John Marshall the chief
of the accomplished and able men who sat with him
on the Supreme Bench at Washington than, even in
his advancing years, he was the leader of the convivial
spirits who gathered to pitch quoits, drink julep
and punch, tell stories, sing songs, make speeches,
and play pranks under the trees of Richmond.</p>

<p>Marshall dearly loved, when at home, to indulge in
the giving of big dinners to members of the bench
and bar. In a wholly personal sense he was the best-liked
man in Richmond. The lawyers and judges
living there were particularly fond of him, and the
Chief Justice thoroughly reciprocated their regard.
Spencer Roane, Judge of the Virginia Court of Appeals,
seems to have been the one enemy Marshall
had in the whole city. Indeed, Roane and Jefferson
appear to have been the only men anywhere who
ever hated him personally. Even the testy George
Hay reluctantly yielded to his engaging qualities.
When at the head of the Virginia bar, Marshall had
been one of those leading attorneys who gave the attractive
dinners that were so notable and delightful
a feature of life in Richmond. After he became Chief
Justice, he continued this custom until his "lawyer
dinners" became, among men, the principal social
events of the place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>Many guests sat at Marshall's board upon these
occasions. Among them were his own sons as well as
those of some of his guests. These dinners were
repetitions within doors of the Quoit Club entertainments,
except that the food was more abundant
and varied, and the cheering drinks were of better
quality&mdash;for Marshall prided himself on this feature
of hospitality, especially on his madeira, of
which he was said to keep the best to be had in
America. Wit and repartee, joke, story and song,
speech and raillery, brought forth volleys of laughter
and roars of applause until far into the morning
hours.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Marshall was not only at the head of the
table as host, but was the leader of the merriment.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>His labors as Chief Justice did not dull his delight
in the reading of poetry and fiction, which was so
keen in his earlier years.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> At the summit of his career,
when seventy-one years old, he read all of Jane
Austen's works, and playfully reproved Story for
failing to name her in a list of authors given in his
Phi Beta Kappa oration at Harvard. "I was a little
mortified," he wrote Story, "to find that you had
not admitted the name of Miss Austen into your
list of favorites. I had just finished reading her novels
when I received your discourse, and was so much
pleased with them that I looked in it for her name,
and was rather disappointed at not finding it. Her
flights are not lofty, she does not soar on eagle's
wings, but she is pleasing, interesting, equable, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
yet amusing. I count on your making some apology
for this omission."<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>Story himself wrote poetry, and Marshall often
asked for copies of his verses.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> "The plan of life I
had formed for myself to be adopted after my retirement
from office," he tells Story, "is to read
nothing but novels and poetry."<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> That this statement
genuinely expressed his tastes is supported
by the fact that, among the few books which the
Chief Justice treasured, were the novels of Sir Walter
Scott and an extensive edition of the British
poets.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> While his chief intellectual pleasure was
the reading of fiction, Marshall liked poetry even
better; and he committed to memory favorite passages
which he quoted as comment on passing incidents.
Once when he was told that certain men had
changed their opinions as a matter of political expediency,
he repeated Homer's lines:</p>

<p class="poem">
"Ye gods, what havoc does ambition make<br />
'Mong all your works."<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a><br />
</p>

<p>During the six or eight weeks that the Supreme
Court sat each year, Marshall was the same in manner
and appearance in Washington as he was among
his neighbors in Richmond&mdash;the same in dress, in
habits, in every way. Once a practitioner sent his
little son to Marshall's quarters for some legal papers.
The boy was in awe of the great man. But the Chief
Justice, detecting the feelings of the lad, remarked:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
"Billy, I believe I can beat you playing marbles;
come into the yard and we will have a game." Soon
the Chief Justice of the United States and the urchin
were hard at play.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>If he reached the court-room before the hour of
convening court, he sat among the lawyers and
talked and joked as if he were one of them;<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> and,
judging from his homely, neglected clothing, an uninformed
onlooker would have taken him for the
least important of the company. Yet there was
about him an unconscious dignity that prevented
any from presuming upon his good nature, for Marshall
inspired respect as well as affection. After
their surprise and disappointment at his ill attire
and want of impressiveness,<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> attorneys coming in
contact with him were unfailingly captivated by his
simplicity and charm.</p>

<p>It was thus that Joseph Story, when a very young
lawyer, first fell under Marshall's spell. "I love his
laugh," he wrote; "it is too hearty for an intriguer,&mdash;and
his good temper and unwearied patience are
equally agreeable on the bench and in the study."<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
And Marshall wore well. The longer and more intimately
men associated with him, the greater their
fondness for him. "I am in love with his character,
positively in love," wrote Story after twenty-four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
years of close and familiar contact.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> He "rises ... with
the nearest survey," again testified Story in a
magazine article.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>When, however, the time came for him to open
court, a transformation came over him. Clad in the
robes of his great office, with the Associate Justices
on either side of him, no king on a throne ever appeared
more majestic than did John Marshall. The
kindly look was still in his eye, the mildness still in
his tones, the benignity in his features. But a gravity
of bearing, a firmness of manner, a concentration
and intentness of mind, seemed literally to take possession
of the man, although he was, and appeared
to be, as unconscious of the change as he was that
there was anything unusual in his conduct when off
the bench.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Marshall said and did things that interested other
people and caused them to talk about him. He was
noted for his quick wit, and the bar was fond of repeating
anecdotes about him. "Did you hear what
the Chief Justice said the other day?"&mdash;and then
the story would be told of a bright saying, a quick
repartee, a picturesque incident. Chief Justice Gibson
of Pennsylvania, when a young man, went to
Marshall for advice as to whether he should accept
a position offered him on the State Bench. The
young attorney, thinking to flatter him, remarked
that the Chief Justice had "reached the acme of
judicial distinction." "Let me tell you what that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
means, young man," broke in Marshall. "The acme
of judicial distinction means the ability to look a
lawyer straight in the eyes for two hours and not
hear a damned word he says."<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>Wherever he happened to be, nothing pleased
Marshall so much as to join a convivial party at dinner
or to attend any sort of informal social gathering.
On one occasion he went to the meeting of a
club at Philadelphia, held in a room at a tavern
across the hall from the bar. It was a rule of the club
that every one present should make a rhyme upon
a word suddenly given. As he entered, the Chief
Justice observed two or three Kentucky colonels
taking their accustomed drink. When Marshall appeared
in the adjoining room, where the company
was gathered, he was asked for an extemporaneous
rhyme on the word "paradox." Looking across the
hall, he quickly answered:</p>

<p class="poem">
"In the Blue Grass region,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A 'Paradox' was born,</span><br />
The corn was full of kernels<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the 'colonels' full of corn."<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>But Marshall heartily disliked the formal society
of the National Capital. He was, of course, often invited
to dinners and receptions, but he was usually
bored by their formality. Occasionally he would
brighten his letters to his wife by short mention of
some entertainment. "Since being in this place,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
he writes her, "I have been more in company than I
wish.... I have been invited to dine with the President
with our own secretaries &amp; with the minister of
France &amp; tomorrow I dine with the British minister....
In the midst of these gay circles my mind is
carried to my own fireside &amp; to my beloved wife."<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>Again: "Soon after dinner yesterday the French
Charg&eacute; d'affaires called upon us with a pressing invitation
to be present at a party given to the young
couple, a gentleman of the French legation &amp; the
daughter of the secretary of the navy who are lately
married. There was a most brilliant illumination
which we saw and admired, &amp; then we returned."<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
Of a dinner at the French Legation he writes his
wife, it was "rather a dull party. Neither the minister
nor his lady could speak English and I could
not speak French. You may conjecture how far we
were from being sociable. Yesterday I dined with
M<sup>r</sup> Van Buren the secretary of State. It was a
grand dinner and the secretary was very polite, but
I was rather dull through the evening. I make a poor
return for these dinners. I go to them with reluctance
and am bad company while there. I hope we
have seen the last, but I fear we must encounter one
more.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> With the exception of these parties my time
was never passed with more uniformity. I rise early,
pour [<i>sic</i>] over law cases, go to court and return at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the same hour and pass the evening in consultation
with the Judges."<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>Chester Harding relates that, when he was in
Washington making a full-length portrait of the
Chief Justice,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Marshall arrived late for the sitting,
which had been fixed for eight o'clock in the evening.
He came without a hat. Congressman Storrs and
one or two other men, having seen Marshall, bare-headed,
hurrying by their inn with long strides, had
"followed, curious to know the cause of such a strange
appearance." But Marshall simply explained to the
artist that the consultation lasted longer than usual,
and that he had hurried off without his hat. When the
Chief Justice was about to go home, Harding offered
him a hat, but he said, "Oh, no! it is a warm night,
I shall not need one."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>No attorney practicing in the Supreme Court was
more unreserved in social conversation than was the
Chief Justice. Sometimes, indeed, on a subject that
appealed to him, Marshall would do all the talking,
which, for some reason, would occasionally be quite
beyond the understanding of his hearer. Of one such
exhibition Fisher Ames remarked to Samuel Dexter:
"I have not understood a word of his argument for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
half an hour." "And I," replied the leader of the
Massachusetts bar, "have been out of my depth for
an hour and a half."<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>The members of the Supreme Court made life as
pleasant for themselves as they could during the
weeks they were compelled to remain in "this dismal"
place, as Daniel Webster described the National
Capital. Marshall and the Associate Justices all
lived together at one boarding-house, and thus became
a sort of family. "We live very harmoniously
and familiarly,"<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> writes Story, one year after his
appointment. "My brethren are very interesting
men," he tells another friend. We "live in the most
frank and unaffected intimacy. Indeed, we are all
united as one, with a mutual esteem which makes
even the labors of Jurisprudence light."<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>Sitting about a single table at their meals, or gathered
in the room of one of them, these men talked
over the cases before them. Not only did they
"moot every question as" the arguments proceeded in
court, but by "familiar conferences at our lodgings
often come to a very quick, and ... accurate opinion,
in a few hours," relates that faithful chronicler of
their daily life, Joseph Story.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Story appears to
have been even more impressed by the comradery
of the members of the Supreme Court than by the
difficulty of the cases they had to decide.</p>

<p>None of them ever took his wife with him to Washington,
and this fact naturally made the personal
relations of the Justices peculiarly close. "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Judges here live with perfect harmony," Story
reiterates, "and as agreeably as absence from
friends and from families could make our residence.
Our intercourse is perfectly familiar and unconstrained,
and our social hours when undisturbed with
the labors of law, are passed in gay and frank conversation,
which at once enlivens and instructs."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>This "gay and frank conversation" of Marshall
and his associates covered every subject&mdash;the
methods, manners, and even dress of counsel who
argued before them, the fortunes of public men, the
trend of politics, the incident of the day, the gossip
of society. "Two of the Judges are widowers," records
Story, "and of course objects of considerable
attraction among the ladies of the city. We have
fine sport at their expense, and amuse our leisure
with some touches at match-making. We have already
ensnared one of the Judges, and he is now (at
the age of forty-seven) violently affected with the
tender passion."<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>Thus Marshall, in his relation with his fellow occupants
of the bench, was at the head of a family as
much as he was Chief of a court. Although the discussion
of legal questions occurred continuously at
the boarding-house, each case was much more fully
examined in the consultation room at the Capitol.
There the court had a regular "consultation day"
devoted exclusively to the cases in hand. Yet, even
on these occasions, all was informality, and wit and
humor brightened the tediousness. These "consul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>tations"
lasted throughout the day and sometimes
into the night; and the Justices took their meals
while the discussions proceeded. Amusing incidents,
some true, some false, and others a mixture, were related
of these judicial meetings. One such story
went the rounds of the bar and outlived the period
of Marshall's life.</p>

<p>"We are great ascetics, and even deny ourselves
wine except in wet weather," Story dutifully informed
his wife. "What I say about the wine gives
you our rule; but it does sometimes happen that the
Chief Justice will say to me, when the cloth is removed,
'Brother Story, step to the window and see
if it does not look like rain.' And if I tell him that
the sun is shining brightly, Judge Marshall will sometimes
reply, 'All the better, for our jurisdiction extends
over so large a territory that the doctrine of
chances makes it certain that it must be raining
somewhere.'"<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>When, as sometimes happened, one of the Associate
Justices displeased a member of the bar, Marshall
would soothe the wounded feelings of the lawyer.
Story once offended Littleton W. Tazewell of
Virginia by something said from the bench. "On
my return from court yesterday," the Chief Justice
hastened to write the irritated Virginian, "I informed
M<sup>r</sup> Story that you had been much hurt at an
expression used in the opinion he had delivered in the
case of the Palmyra. He expressed equal surprize
and regret on the occasion, and declared that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
words which had given offense were not used or understood
by him in an offensive sense. He assented
without hesitation to such modification of them as
would render them in your view entirely unexceptionable."<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>As Chief Justice, Marshall shrank from publicity,
while printed adulation aggravated him. "I hope to
God they will let me alone 'till I am dead," he exclaimed,
when he had reached that eminence where
writers sought to portray his life and character.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>He did, however, appreciate the recognition given
from time to time by colleges and learned societies.
In 1802 Princeton conferred upon him the honorary
degree of LL.D.; in 1806 he received the same degree
from Harvard and from the University of Pennsylvania
in 1815. In 1809, as we have seen, he was
elected a corresponding member of the Massachusetts
Historical Society; on January 24, 1804, he
was made a member of the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences; and, in 1830, was elected to the
American Philosophical Society. All these honors
Marshall valued highly.</p>

<p>This, then, was the man who presided over the
Supreme Court of the United States when the decisions
of that tribunal developed the National powers
of the Constitution and gave stability to our National
life. His control of the court was made so
easy for the Justices that they never resented it;
often, perhaps, they did not realize it. The influence
of his strong, deep, clear mind was powerfully aided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
by his engaging personality. To agree with him was
a pleasure.</p>

<p>Marshall's charm was as great as his intellect; he
was never irritable; his placidity was seldom ruffled;
not often was his good nature disturbed. His "great
suavity, or rather calmness of manner, cannot readily
be conceived," testifies George Bancroft.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> The
sheer magnitude of his views was, in itself, captivating,
and his supremely lucid reasoning removed the
confusion which more complex and subtle minds
would have created in reaching the same conclusion.
The elements of his mind and character were such,
and were so combined, that it was both hard and unpleasant
to differ with him, and both easy and agreeable
to follow his lead.</p>

<p>Above all other influences upon his associates on
the bench, and, indeed, upon everybody who knew
him, was the sense of trustworthiness, honor, and
uprightness he inspired.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Perhaps no public man
ever stood higher in the esteem of his contemporaries
for noble personal qualities than did John Marshall.</p>

<p>When reviewing his constructive work and marveling
at his influence over his judicial associates,
we must recall, even at the risk of iteration, the
figure revealed by his daily life and habits&mdash;"a
man who is tall to awkwardness, with a large head of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
hair, which looked as if it had not been lately tied or
combed, and with dirty boots,"<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> a body that seemed
"without proportion," and arms and legs that
"dangled from each other and looked half dislocated,"
dressed in clothes apparently "gotten from
some antiquated slop-shop of second-hand raiment ... the
coat and breeches cut for nobody in particular."<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
But we must also think of such a man
as possessed of "style and tones in conversation
uncommonly mild, gentle, and conciliating."<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> We
must think of his hearty laughter, his "imperturbable
temper,"<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> his shyness with strangers, his quaint
humor, his hilarious unreserve with friends and convivial
jocularity when with intimates, his cordial
warm-heartedness, unassuming simplicity and sincere
gentleness to all who came in contact with him&mdash;a
man without "an atom of gall in his whole
composition."<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> We must picture this distinctive
American character among his associates of the
bench in the Washington boarding-house no less than
in court, his luminous mind guiding them, his irresistible
personality drawing from them a real and
lasting affection. We must bear in mind the trust
and confidence which so powerfully impressed those
who knew the man. We must imagine a person very
much like Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<p>Indeed, the resemblance of Marshall to Lincoln
is striking. Between no two men in American history
is there such a likeness. Physically, intellectually,
and in characteristics, Marshall and Lincoln
were of the same type. Both were very tall
men, slender, loose-jointed, and awkward, but
powerful and athletic; and both fond of sport. So
alike were they, and so identical in their negligence
of dress and their total unconsciousness of,
or indifference to, convention, that the two men,
walking side by side, might well have been taken
for brothers.</p>

<p>Both Marshall and Lincoln loved companionship
with the same heartiness, and both had the same
social qualities. They enjoyed fun, jokes, laughter,
in equal measure, and had the same keen appreciation
of wit and humor. Their mental qualities were
the same. Each man had the gift of going directly
to the heart of any subject; while the same lucidity
of statement marked each of them. Their style, the
simplicity of their language, the peculiar clearness
of their logic, were almost identical. Notwithstanding
their straightforwardness and amplitude of
mind, both had a curious subtlety. Some of Marshall's
opinions and Lincoln's state papers might
have been written by the same man. The "Freeholder"
questions and answers in Marshall's congressional
campaign, and those of Lincoln's debate
with Douglas, are strikingly similar in method and
expression.</p>

<p>Each had a genius for managing men; and Marshall
showed the precise traits in dealing with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
members of the Supreme Court that Lincoln displayed
in the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Both were born in the South, each on the eve of a
great epoch in American history when a new spirit
was awakening in the hearts of the people. Although
Southern-born, both Marshall and Lincoln sympathized
with and believed in the North; and yet their
manners and instinct were always those of the South.
Marshall was given advantages that Lincoln never
had; but both were men of the people, were brought
up among them, and knew them thoroughly. Lincoln's
outlook upon life, however, was that of the
humblest citizen; Marshall's that of the well-placed
and prosperous. Neither was well educated, but
each acquired, in different ways, a command of excellent
English and broad, plain conceptions of government
and of life. Neither was a learned man,
but both created the materials for learning.</p>

<p>Marshall and Lincoln were equally good politicians;
but, although both were conservative in their
mental processes, Marshall lost faith in the people's
steadiness, moderation, and self-restraint; and came
to think that impulse rather than wisdom was too
often the temporary moving power in the popular
mind, while the confidence of Lincoln in the good
sense, righteousness, and self-control of the people
became greater as his life advanced. If, with these
distinctions, Abraham Lincoln were, in imagination,
placed upon the Supreme Bench during the period
we are now considering, we should have a good idea
of John Marshall, the Chief Justice of the United
States.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>It is, then, largely the personality of John Marshall
that explains the hold, as firm and persistent as
it was gentle and soothing, maintained by him upon
the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court; and it is
this, too, that enables us to understand his immense
popularity with the bar&mdash;a fact only second in importance
to the work he had to do, and to his influence
upon the men who sat with him on the bench.</p>

<p>For the lawyers who practiced before the Supreme
Court at this period were most helpful to Marshall.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
Many of them were men of wide and accurate
learning, and nearly all of them were of the first order
of ability. No stronger or more brilliant bar ever
was arrayed before any bench than that which displayed
its wealth of intellect and resources to Marshall
and his associates.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> This assertion is strong,
but wholly justified. Oratory of the finest quality,
though of the old rhetorical kind, filled the court-room
with admiring spectators, and entertained
Marshall and the other Justices, as much as the solid
reasoning illuminated their minds, and the exhaustive
learning informed them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Marshall encouraged extended arguments; often
demanded them. Frequently a single lawyer would
speak for two or three days. No limit of time was
put upon counsel.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Their reputation as speakers
as well as their fame as lawyers, together with the
throngs of auditors always present, put them on their
mettle. Rhetoric adorned logic; often encumbered it.
A conflict between such men as William Pinkney,
Luther Martin of Maryland, Samuel Dexter of
Massachusetts, Thomas Addis Emmet of New York,
William Wirt of Virginia, Joseph Hopkinson of Pennsylvania,
Jeremiah Mason of New Hampshire, Daniel
Webster, Henry Clay, and others of scarcely less
distinction, was, in itself, an event. These men, and
indeed all the members of the bar, were Marshall's
friends as well as admirers.</p>

<p>The appointment of Story to the Supreme Bench
was, like the other determining circumstances in
Marshall's career, providential.</p>

<p>Few characters in American history are more
attractive than the New England lawyer and publicist
who, at the age of thirty-two, took his place
at Marshall's side on the Supreme Bench. Hand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>some,
vivacious, impressionable, his mind was a
storehouse of knowledge, accurately measured and
systematically arranged. He read everything, forgot
nothing. His mental appetite was voracious, and
he had a very passion for research. His industry was
untiring, his memory unfailing. He supplied exactly
the accomplishment and toilsomeness that Marshall
lacked. So perfectly did the qualities and attainments
of these two men supplement one another
that, in the work of building the American Nation,
Marshall and Story may be considered one and the
same person.</p>

<p>Where Marshall was leisurely, Story was eager.
If the attainments of the Chief Justice were not
profuse, those of his young associate were opulent.
Marshall detested the labor of investigating legal
authorities; Story delighted in it. The intellect of the
older man was more massive and sure; but that of
the youthful Justice was not far inferior in strength,
or much less clear and direct in its operation. Marshall
steadied Story while Story enriched Marshall.
Each admired the other, and between them grew an
affection like that of father and son.</p>

<p>Story's father, Elisha Story, was a member of the
Republican Party, a rare person among wealthy and
educated men in Massachusetts at the time Jefferson
founded that political organization. The son
tells us that he "naturally imbibed the same opinions,"
which were so reprobated that not "more than
four or five lawyers in the whole state ... <i>dared</i> avow
themselves republicans. The very name was odious."<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p>Joseph Story was born in Marblehead, Massachusetts,
September 18, 1779, one of a family of eighteen
children, seven by a first wife and eleven by a second.
He was the eldest son of the second wife, who had
been a Miss Pedrick, the daughter of a rich merchant

<p>No young member of the Massachusetts bar
equaled Joseph Story in intellectual gifts and acquirements.
He was a graduate of Harvard, and few
men anywhere had a broader or more accurate education.
His personality was winning and full of charm.
Yet, when he began practice at Salem, he was "persecuted"
with "extreme ... virulence" because of his
political opinions.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> He became so depressed by what
he calls "the petty prejudices and sullen coolness of
New England, ... bigoted in opinion and satisfied in
forms," where Federalism had "persecuted ... [him]
unrelentingly for ... [his] political principles," that
he thought seriously of going to Baltimore to live
and practice his profession. He made headway,
however, in spite of opposition; and, when the growing
Republican Party, "the whole" of which he says
were his "warm advocates,"<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> secured the majority
of his district, Story was sent to Congress. "I was
... of course a supporter of the administration of
Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Madison," although not "a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
mere slave to the opinions of either." In exercising
what he terms his "independent judgment,"<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Story
favored the repeal of the Embargo, and so earned,
henceforth, the lasting enmity of Jefferson.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>Because of his recognized talents, and perhaps
also because of the political party to which he belonged,
he was employed to go to Washington as
attorney for the New England and Mississippi Company
in the Yazoo controversy.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> It was at this
period that the New England Federalist leaders began
to cultivate him. They appreciated his ability,
and the assertion of his "independent principles"
was to their liking. Harrison Gray Otis was quick
to advise that seasoned politician, Robert Goodloe
Harper, of the change he thought observable in
Story, and the benefit of winning his regard. "He is
a young man of talents, who commenced Democrat
a few years since and was much fondled by his
party," writes Otis. "He discovered however too
much sentiment and honor to go <i>all lengths</i> ... and
a little attention from the right sort of people will
be very useful to him &amp; to us."<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>The wise George Cabot gave Pickering the same
hint when Story made one of his trips to Washington
on the Yazoo business. "Though he is a man whom
the Democrats support," says Cabot, "I have seldom
if ever met with one of sounder mind on the principal
points of national policy. He is well worthy the civil
attention of the most respectable Federalists."<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>It was while in the Capital, as attorney before
Congress and the Supreme Court in the Georgia
land controversy, that Story, then twenty-nine
years old, met Marshall; and impulsively wrote of his
delight in the "hearty laugh," "patience," consideration,
and ability of the Chief Justice. On this
visit to Washington the young Massachusetts lawyer
took most of his meals with the members of the
Supreme Court.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> At that time began the devotion
of Joseph Story to John Marshall which was to
prove so helpful to both for more than a generation,
and so influential upon the Republic for all time.</p>

<p>That Story, while in Washington, had copiously
expressed his changing opinions, as well as his disapproval
of Jefferson's Embargo, is certain; for he
was "a very great talker,"<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> and stated his ideas with
the volubility of his extremely exuberant nature.
"At this time, as in after life," declares Story's son,
"he was remarkable for fulness and fluency of conversation.
It poured out from his mind ... sparkling,
and exhaustless. Language was as a wide open sluice,
through which every feeling and thought rushed
forth.... It would be impossible to give an idea of his
conversational powers."<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>It was not strange, then, that Jefferson, who was
eager for all gossip and managed to learn everything
that happened, or was said to have happened, in
Washington, heard of Story's association with the
Federalists, his unguarded talk, and especially his
admiration for the Chief Justice. It was plain to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Jefferson that such a person would never resist Marshall's
influence.</p>

<p>In Jefferson's mind existed another objection to
Story which may justly be inferred from the situation
in which he found himself when the problem
arose of filling the place on the Supreme Bench vacated
by the death of Justice Cushing. Story had
made a profound study of the law of real estate; and,
young though he was, no lawyer in America equaled
him, and few in England surpassed him, in the intricate
learning of that branch of legal science. This
fact was well known to the bar at Washington as well
as to that of Massachusetts. Therefore, the thought
of Story on the Supreme Bench, and under Marshall's
influence, made Jefferson acutely uncomfortable;
for the former President was then engaged in a
lawsuit involving questions of real estate which, if
decided against him, would, as he avowed, ruin him.
This lawsuit was the famous Batture litigation. It
was this predicament that led Jefferson to try to
control the appointment of the successor to Cushing,
whose death he declared to be "a Godsend"<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> to him
personally; and also to dictate the naming of the
district judge at Richmond to the vacancy caused
by the demise of Judge Cyrus Griffin.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1810, Edward Livingston, formerly
of New York and then of New Orleans,
brought suit in the United States Court for the District
of Virginia against Thomas Jefferson for damages
to the amount of one hundred thousand dollars.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
This was the same Livingston who in Congress had
been the Republican leader in the House when Marshall
was a member of that body.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Afterwards he
was appointed United States Attorney for the District
of New York and then became Mayor of that
city. During the yellow fever epidemic that scourged
New York in 1803, Livingston devoted himself to
the care of the victims of the plague, leaving the
administration of the Mayor's office to a trusted
clerk. In time Livingston, too, was stricken. During
his illness his clerk embezzled large sums of the
public money. The Mayor was liable and, upon his
recovery, did not attempt to evade responsibility,
but resigned his office and gave all his property to
make good the defalcation. A heavy amount, however,
still remained unpaid; and the discharge of
this obligation became the ruling purpose of Livingston's
life until, twenty years afterward, he accomplished
his object.</p>

<p>His health regained, Livingston went to New
Orleans to seek fortune anew. There he soon became
the leader of the bar. When Wilkinson set up his
reign of terror in that city, it was Edward Livingston
who swore out writs of habeas corpus for those illegally
imprisoned and, in general, was the most vigorous
as well as the ablest of those who opposed Wilkinson's
lawless and violent measures.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> Jefferson
had been displeased that Livingston had not shown
more enthusiasm for him, when, in 1801, the Federalists
had tried to elect Burr to the Presidency,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
and bitterly resented Livingston's interference with
Wilkinson's plans to "suppress treason" in New
Orleans.</p>

<p>One John Gravier, a lifelong resident of that city,
had inherited from his brother Bertrand certain real
estate abutting the river. Between this and the
water the current had deposited an immense quantity
of alluvium. The question of the title to this
river-made land had never been raised, and everybody
used it as a sort of common wharf front. Alert
for opportunities to make money with which fully to
discharge the defalcation in the New York Mayor's
office, Livingston investigated the rightful ownership
of the batture, as the alluvial deposit was termed;
satisfied himself that the title was in Gravier; gave
an opinion to that effect, and brought suit for the
property as Gravier's attorney.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> While the trial of
Aaron Burr was in progress in Richmond, the Circuit
Court in New Orleans rendered judgment in
favor of Gravier,<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> who then conveyed half of his
rights to his attorney, apparently as a fee for the
recovery of the batture.</p>

<p>Livingston immediately began to improve his
property, whereupon the people became excited and
drove away his workmen. Governor Claiborne refused
to protect him and referred the whole matter
to Jefferson. The President did not direct the Attorney-General
to bring suit for the possession of the
batture&mdash;the obvious and the legal form of procedure.
Indeed, the title to the property was not so
much as examined. Jefferson did not even take into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
consideration the fact that, if Livingston was not the
rightful owner of the batture, it might belong to
the City of New Orleans. He merely assumed that
it was National property; and, hastily acting under
a law against squatters on lands belonging to the
United States, he directed Secretary of State Madison
to have all persons removed from the disputed premises.
Accordingly, the United States Marshal was
ordered to eject the "intruder" and his laborers.
This was done; but Livingston told his men to return
to their work and secured an injunction against
the Marshal from further molesting them. That
official ignored the order of the court and again drove
the laborers off the batture.</p>

<p>Livingston begged the President to submit the
controversy to arbitration or to judicial decision,
but Jefferson was deaf to his pleas. The distracted
lawyer appealed to Congress for relief.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> That body
ignored his petition.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> He then brought suit against
the Marshal in New Orleans for the recovery of his
property. Soon afterward he brought another in Virginia
against Jefferson for one hundred thousand
dollars damages. Such, in brief outline, was the beginning
of the famous "Batture Controversy," in
which Jefferson and Livingston waged a war of
pamphlets for years.</p>

<p>When he learned that Livingston had begun action
against him in the Federal court at Richmond, Jefferson
was much alarmed. In anticipation of the
death of Judge Cyrus Griffin, Governor John Tyler<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
had written Jefferson that, while he "never did apply
for an office," yet "Judge Griffin is in a low
state of health, and holds my old office." Tyler
continues: "I really hope the President will chance
to think of me ... in case of accidents, and if an opportunity
offers, lay me down softly on a bed of <i>roses in
my latter days</i>." He condemns Marshall for his opposition
to the War of 1812, and especially for his
reputed statement that Great Britain had done
nothing to justify armed retaliation on our part.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
"Is it possible," asks Tyler, "that a man who can
assert this, can have any true sense of sound veracity?
And yet these sort of folks retain their stations and
consequence in life."<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>Immediately Jefferson wrote to President Madison:
"From what I can learn Griffin cannot stand it long,
and really the state has suffered long enough by
having such a cypher in so important an office, and
infinitely the more from the want of any counter-point
to the rancorous hatred which Marshall bears
to the government of his country, &amp; from the cunning
&amp; sophistry within which he is able to enshroud
himself. It will be difficult to find a character of
firmness enough to preserve his independence on
the same bench with Marshall. Tyler, I am certain,
would do it.... A milk &amp; water character ... would
be seen as a calamity. Tyler having been the former
state judge of that court too, and removed to make
way for so wretched a fool as Griffin,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> has a kind of
right of reclamation."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Jefferson gives other reasons for the appointment
of Tyler, and then addresses Madison thus: "You
have seen in the papers that Livingston has served
a writ on me, stating damages at 100,000. D... I
shall soon look into my papers to make a state of
the case to enable them to plead." Jefferson hints
broadly that he may have to summon as witnesses
his "associates in the proceedings," one of whom
was Madison himself.</p>

<p>He concludes this astounding letter in these
words: "It is a little doubted that his [Livingston's]
knolege [<i>sic</i>] of Marshall's character has induced him
to bring this action. His twistifications of the law
in the case of Marbury, in that of Burr, &amp; the late
Yazoo case shew how dexterously he can reconcile law
to his personal biasses: and nobody seems to doubt
that he is ready prepared to decide that Livingston's
right to the batture is unquestionable, and that I
am bound to pay for it with my private fortune."<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>The next day Jefferson wrote Tyler that he had
"laid it down as a law" to himself "never to embarrass
the President with any solicitations." Yet, in
Tyler's case, says Jefferson, "I ... have done it with
all my heart, and in the full belief that I serve him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
and the public in urging the appointment." For,
Jefferson confides to the man who, in case Madison
named him, would, with Marshall, hear the suit,
"we have long enough suffered under the base prostitution
of the law to party passions in one judge,
and the imbecility of another.</p>

<p>"In the hands of one [Marshall] the law is nothing
more than an ambiguous text, to be explained by his
sophistry into any meaning which may subserve
his personal malice. Nor can any milk-and-water associate
maintain his own independence, and by a firm
pursuance of what the law really is, extend its protection
to the citizens or the public.... And where you
cannot induce your colleague to do what is right,
you will be firm enough to hinder him from doing
what is wrong, and by opposing sense to sophistry,
leave the juries free to follow their own judgment."<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>Upon the death of Judge Griffin in the following
December, John Tyler was appointed to succeed
him.</p>

<p>On September 13, 1810, William Cushing, Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court, died. Only three Federalists
now remained on the Supreme Bench, Samuel
Chase, Bushrod Washington, and John Marshall.
The other Justices, William Johnson of South Carolina,
Brockholst Livingston of New York, and Thomas
Todd of Kentucky, were Republicans, appointed
by Jefferson. The selection of Cushing's successor
would give the majority of the court to the Republican
Party for the first time since its organization.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
That Madison would fill the vacancy by one of his
own following was certain; but this was not enough
to satisfy Jefferson, who wanted to make sure that
the man selected was one who would not fall under
Marshall's baleful influence. If Griffin did not die in
time, Jefferson's fate in the batture litigation would
be in Marshall's hands.</p>

<p>Should Griffin be polite enough to breathe his
last promptly and Tyler be appointed in season, still
Jefferson would not feel safe&mdash;the case might go
to the jury, and who could tell what their verdict
would be under Marshall's instructions? Even Tyler
might not be able to "hinder" Marshall "from wrong
doing"; for nothing was more probable than that,
no matter what the issue of the case might be, it
would be carried to the Supreme Court if any ground
for appeal could be found. Certainly Jefferson would
take it there if the case should go against him. It was
vital, therefore, that the latest vacancy on the Supreme
Bench should also be filled by a man on whom
Jefferson could depend.</p>

<p>The new Justice must come from New England,
Cushing having presided over that circuit. Republican
lawyers there, fit for the place, were at that
time extremely hard to find. Jefferson had been
corresponding about the batture case with Gallatin,
who had been his Secretary of the Treasury and continued
in that office under Madison. The moment
he learned of Cushing's death, Jefferson wrote to
Gallatin in answer to a letter from that able man,
admitting that "the Batture ... could not be within
the scope of the law ... against squatters," under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
color of which Livingston had been forcibly ousted
from that property. Jefferson adds: "I should so
adjudge myself; yet I observe many opinions otherwise,
and in defence against a spadassin it is lawful
to use all weapons." The case is complex;
still no unbiased man "can doubt what the issue
of the case ought to be. What it will be, no one
can tell.</p>

<p>"The judge's [Marshall's] inveteracy is profound,
and his mind of that gloomy malignity which will
never let him forego the opportunity of satiating it
on a victim. His decisions, his instructions to a jury,
his allowances and disallowances and garblings of
evidence, must all be subjects of appeal.... And to
whom is my appeal? From the judge in Burr's case
to himself and his associate judges in the case of
Marbury <span class="smcap">v.</span> Madison.</p>

<p>"Not exactly, however. I observe old Cushing is
dead.... The event is a fortunate one, and so timed
as to be a Godsend to me. I am sure its importance
to the nation will be felt, and the occasion employed
to complete the great operation they have so long
been executing, by the appointment of a decided
Republican, with nothing equivocal about him. But
who will it be?"</p>

<p>Jefferson warmly recommends Levi Lincoln, his
former Attorney-General. Since the new Justice
must come from New England, "can any other bring
equal qualifications?... I know he was not deemed
a profound common lawyer; but was there ever a
profound common lawyer known in one of the
Eastern States? There never was, nor never can be,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
one from those States.... Mr. Lincoln is ... as learned
in their laws as any one they have."<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>After allowing time for Gallatin to carry this message
to the President, Jefferson wrote directly to
Madison. He congratulates him on "the revocation
of the French decrees"; abuses Great Britain for her
"principle" of "the exclusive right to the sea by conquest";
and then comes to the matter of the vacancy
on the Supreme Bench.</p>

<p>"Another circumstance of congratulation is the
death of Cushing," which "gives an opportunity of
closing the reformation [the Republican triumph of
1800] by a successor of unquestionable republican
principles." Jefferson suggests Lincoln. "Were he
out of the way," then Gideon Granger ought to be
chosen, "tho' I am sensible that J.[ohn] R.[andolph]
has been able to lessen the confidence of many in
him.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>... As the choice must be of a New Englander,
... I confess I know of none but these two characters."
Of course there was Joseph Story, but he is "unquestionably
a tory," and "too young."<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>Madison strove to follow Jefferson's desires. Cushing's
place was promptly offered to Lincoln, who de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>clined
it because of approaching blindness. Granger,
of course, was impossible&mdash;the Senate would not
have confirmed him. So Alexander Wolcott, "an
active Democratic politician of Connecticut," of
mediocre ability and "rather dubious ... character,"<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
was nominated; but the Senate rejected him. It
seemed impossible to find a competent lawyer in
New England who would satisfy Jefferson's requirements.
John Quincy Adams, who had deserted the
Federalist Party and acted with the Republicans,
and who was then Minister to Russia, was appointed
and promptly confirmed. Jefferson himself had not
denounced Marshall so scathingly as had Adams in
his report to the Senate on the proposed expulsion
of Senator John Smith of Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> It was certain that
he would not, as Associate Justice, be controlled
by the Chief Justice. But Adams preferred to continue
in his diplomatic post, and refused the appointment.</p>

<p>Thus Story became the only possible choice. After
all, he was still believed to be a Republican by everybody
except Jefferson and the few Federalist leaders
who had been discreetly cultivating him. At least
his appointment would not be so bad as the selection
of an out-and-out Federalist. On November 18,
1811, therefore, Joseph Story was made an Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States. In Massachusetts his appointment "was
ridiculed and condemned."<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>Although Jefferson afterward declared that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
"had a strong desire that the public should have
been satisfied by a trial on the merits,"<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> he was willing
that his counsel should prevent the case from
coming to trial if they could. Fearing, however, that
they would not succeed, Jefferson had prepared, for
the use of his attorneys, an exhaustive brief covering
his version of the facts and his views of the law.
Spencer Roane, Judge of the Virginia Court of Appeals,
and as hot a partisan of Jefferson as he was
an implacable enemy of Marshall, read this manuscript
and gave Tyler "some of the outlines of it."
Tyler explains this to Jefferson after the decision in
his favor, and adds that, much as Tyler wanted to
get hold of Jefferson's brief, still, "as soon as I had
received the appointment ... (which I owe to your
favor in great measure), it became my duty to shut
the door against every observation which might in
any way be derived from either side, lest the impudent
British faction, who had enlisted on Livingston's
side, might suppose an undue influence had
seized upon me."<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>The case aroused keen interest in Virginia and, indeed,
throughout the country. Jefferson was still the
leader of the Republican Party and was as much beloved
and revered as ever by the great majority of the
people. When, therefore, he was sued for so large a
sum of money, the fact excited wide and lively attention.
That the plaintiff was such a man as Edward
Livingston gave sharper edge to the general interest.
Especially among lawyers, curiosity as to the out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>come
was keen. In Richmond, of course, "great
expectation was excited."</p>

<p>When the case came on for hearing, Tyler was so
ill from a very painful affliction that he could scarcely
sit through the hearing; but he persisted because he
had "determined to give an opinion." The question
of jurisdiction alone was argued and only this was
decided. Both judges agreed that the court had no
jurisdiction, though Marshall did so with great reluctance.
He wished "to carry the cause to the Supreme
Court, by adjournment or somehow or other;
but," says Tyler in his report to Jefferson, "I pressed
the propriety of [its] being decided."<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>Marshall, however, delivered a written opinion in
which he gravely reflected on Jefferson's good faith
in avoiding a trial on the merits. If the court, upon
mere technicality, were prevented from trying and
deciding the case, "the injured party may have a
clear right without a remedy"; and that, too, "in a
case where a person who has done the wrong, and
who ought to make the compensation, is within the
power of the court." The situation created by Jefferson's
objection to the court's jurisdiction was unfortunate:
"Where the remedy is against the person,
and is within the power of the court, I have not yet
discerned a reason, other than a technical one, which
can satisfy my judgment" why the case should not
be tried and justice done.</p>

<p>"If, however," continues Marshall, "this technical
reason is firmly established, if all other judges respect
it, I cannot venture to disregard it," no matter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
how wrong in principle and injurious to Livingston
the Chief Justice might think it. If Lord Mansfield,
"one of the greatest judges who ever sat upon any
bench, and who has done more than any other, to
remove those technical impediments which ... too
long continued to obstruct the course of substantial
justice," had vainly attempted to remove the very
"technical impediments" which Jefferson had thrown
in Livingston's way, Marshall would not make the
same fruitless effort.</p>

<p>To be sure, the technical point raised by Jefferson's
counsel was a legal fiction derived from "the common
law of England"; but "this common law has been
adopted by the legislature of Virginia"; and "had it
not been adopted, I should have thought it in force."
Thus Marshall, by innuendo, blames Jefferson for invoking,
for his own protection, a technicality of that
very common law which the latter had so often and so
violently denounced. For the third time Marshall deplores
the use of a technicality "which produces the
inconvenience of a clear right without a remedy."
"Other judges have felt the weight of this argument,
and have struggled ineffectually against" it; so, he
concluded, "I must submit to it."<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>Thus it was that Jefferson at last escaped; for it was
nothing less than an escape. What a decision on the
merits of the case would have been is shown by the
opinion of Chancellor Kent, stated with his characteristic
emphasis. Jefferson was anxious that the
public should think that he was in the right. "Mr.
Livingston's suit having gone off on the plea to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
jurisdiction, it's foundation remains of course unexplained
to the public. I have therefore concluded to
make it public thro' the ... press.... I am well satisfied
to be relieved from it, altho' I had a strong desire
that the public should have been satisfied by a trial
on the merits."<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Accordingly, Jefferson prepared his
statement of the controversy and, curiously enough,
published it just before Livingston's suit against the
United States Marshal in New Orleans was approaching
decision. To no other of his documents did he
give more patient and laborious care. Livingston
replied in an article<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> which justified the great reputation
for ability and learning he was soon to acquire
in both Europe and America.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> Kent followed this
written debate carefully. When Livingston's answer
appeared, Kent wrote him: "I read it eagerly and
studied it thoroughly, with a re-examination of
Jefferson as I went along; and I should now be
as willing to subscribe my name to the validity of
your title and to the atrocious injustice you have
received as to any opinion contained in Johnson's
Reports."<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Marshall's attitude in the Batture litigation intensified
Jefferson's hatred for the Chief Justice,
while Jefferson's conduct in the whole matter still
further deepened Marshall's already profound belief
that the great exponent of popular government was
dishonest and cowardly. Story shared Marshall's
views; indeed, the Batture controversy may be said
to have furnished that personal element which
completed Story's forming antagonism to Jefferson.
"Who ... can remember, without regret, his conduct
in relation to the batture of New Orleans?" wrote
Story many years afterward.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>The Chief Justice attributed the attacks which
Jefferson made upon him in later years to his opinion
in Livingston <i>vs.</i> Jefferson, and to the views he was
known to have held as to the merits of that case and
Jefferson's course in relation to it. "The Batture
will never be forgotten," wrote the Chief Justice
some years later when commenting on the attacks
upon the National Judiciary which he attributed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Jefferson.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Again: "The case of the mandamus<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> may
be the cloak, but the batture is recollected with still
more resentment."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>Events thus sharpened the hostility of Jefferson
and his following to Marshall, but drew closer the
bonds between the Chief Justice and Joseph Story.
Once under Marshall's pleasing, steady, powerful
influence, Story sped along the path of Nationalism
until sometimes he was ahead of the great constructor
who, as he advanced, was building an enduring
and practicable highway.</p>

Kent was appointed Chancellor of the State of New York, Feb. 25,

Notwithstanding Jefferson's hostility, Livingston grew in public
favor, was elected to the Louisiana State Legislature and then to
Congress, where his work was notable. Later, in 1829, he was chosen
United States Senator from that State; and, after serving one term,
was appointed Secretary of State by President Jackson. In this office
he prepared most of the President's state papers and wrote Jackson's
great Nullification Proclamation in 1832.

Livingston was then sent as Minister to France and, by his brilliant
conduct of the negotiations over the French Spoliation Claims, secured
the payment of them. He won fame throughout Europe and Spanish
America by his various works on the penal code and code of procedure.
In the learning of the law he was not far inferior to Story and Kent.

<h3>INTERNATIONAL LAW</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It was Marshall's lot in more than one case to blaze the way in the establishment
of rules of international conduct. (John Bassett Moore.)</p>

<p>The defects of our system of government must be remedied, not by the judiciary,
but by the sovereign power of the people.
(Judge William H. Cabell of the Virginia Court of Appeals.)</p>

<p>I look upon this question as one which may affect, in its consequences, the
permanence of the American Union.
(Justice William Johnson of the Supreme Court.)
</p></div>


<p>While Marshall unhesitatingly struck down State
laws and shackled State authority, he just as firmly
and promptly upheld National laws and National
authority. In Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison he proclaimed
the power of National courts over Congressional legislation
so that the denial of that power might not
be admitted at a time when, to do so, would have
yielded forever the vital principle of Judiciary supervision.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
But that opinion is the significant exception
to his otherwise unbroken practice of recognizing the
validity of acts of Congress.</p>

<p>He carried out this practice even when he believed
the law before him to be unwise in itself, injurious to
the Nation, and, indeed, of extremely doubtful constitutionality.
This course was but a part of Marshall's
Nationalist policy. The purpose of his life
was to strengthen and enlarge the powers of the
National Government; to co&ouml;rdinate into harmonious
operation its various departments; and to
make it in fact, as well as in principle, the agent of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
a people constituting a single, a strong, and efficient
Nation.</p>

<p>A good example of his maintenance of National
laws is his treatment of the Embargo, Non-Importation,
and Non-Intercourse Acts. The hostility of
the Chief Justice to those statutes was, as we have
seen, extreme; the political party of which he was
an ardent member had denounced them as unconstitutional;
his closest friends thought them invalid.
He himself considered them to be, if within the Constitution
at all, on the periphery of it;<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> he believed
them to be ruinous to the country and meant as an
undeserved blow at Great Britain upon whose victory
over France depended, in his opinion, the safety
of America and the rescue of imperiled civilization.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, not once did Marshall, in his many
opinions, so much as suggest a doubt of the validity
of those measures, when cases came before him arising
from them and requiring their interpretation
and application. Most of these decisions are not
now of the slightest historical importance.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> His opinions
relating to the Embargo are, indeed, tiresome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
and dull, with scarcely a flash of genius to brighten
them. Now and then, but so rarely that search for
it is not worth making, a paragraph blazes with the
statement of a great principle. In the case of the
Ship Adventure and Her Cargo, one such statesmanlike
expression illuminates the page. The Non-Intercourse
Law forbade importation of British
goods "from any foreign port or place whatever."
The British ship Adventure had been captured by a
French frigate and given to the master and crew of an
American brig which the Frenchmen had previously
taken. The Americans brought the Adventure into
Norfolk, Virginia, and there claimed the proceeds of
ship and cargo. The United States insisted that ship
and cargo should be forfeited to the Government because
brought in from "a foreign place." But, said
Marshall on this point: "The broad navigable ocean,
which is emphatically and truly termed the great
highway of nations, cannot ... be denominated 'a
foreign place.'... The sea is the common property of
all nations. It belongs equally to all. None can appropriate
it exclusively to themselves; nor is it 'foreign'
to any."<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Where special learning, or the examination of the
technicalities and nice distinctions of the law were required,
Marshall did not shine. Of admiralty law in
particular he knew little. The preparation of opinions
in such cases he usually assigned to Story who,
not unjustly, has been considered the father of American
admiralty law.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Also, in knowledge of the intricate
law of real estate, Story was the superior of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Marshall and, indeed, of all the other members of
the court. Story's pre&euml;minence in most branches of
legal learning was admitted by his associates, all
of whom gladly handed over to the youthful Justice
more than his share of work. Story was flattered
by the recognition. "My brethren were so kind as
to place confidence in my researches,"<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> he tells his
friend Judge Samuel Fay.</p>

<p>During the entire twenty-four years that Marshall
and Story were together on the Supreme Bench the
Chief Justice sought and accepted the younger man's
judgment and frankly acknowledged his authority
in every variety of legal questions, excepting only
those of international law or the interpretation of the
Constitution. "I wish to consult you on a case which
to me who am not versed in admiralty proceedings
has some difficulty," Marshall writes to Story in
1819.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> In another letter Marshall asks Story's help
on a "question of great consequence."<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Again and
again he requests the assistance of his learned junior
associate.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Sometimes he addresses Story as though
that erudite Justice were his superior.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Small wonder
that John Marshall should declare that Story's
"loss would be irreparable" to the Supreme Bench,
if he should be appointed to the place made vacant by
the death of Chief Justice Parker of Massachusetts.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Only in his expositions of the Constitution did
Marshall take supreme command. If he did anything
pre&euml;minent, other than the infusing of life into that
instrument and thus creating a steadying force in the
rampant activities of the young American people, it
was his contributions to international law, which were
of the highest order.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>The first two decades of his labors as Chief Justice
were prolific in problems involving international relations.
The capture of neutral ships by the European
belligerents; the complications incident to the struggle
of Spanish provinces in South America for independence;
the tangle of conflicting claims growing out of
the African slave trade&mdash;the unsettled questions
arising from all these sources made that period of
Marshall's services unique in the number, importance,
and novelty of cases requiring new and authoritative
announcements of the law of nations. An
outline of three or four of his opinions in such cases
will show the quality of his work in that field of legal
science and also illustrate his broad conception of
some of the fundamentals of American statesmanship
in foreign affairs.</p>

<p>His opinion in the case of the Schooner Exchange
lays down principles which embrace much more than
was involved in the question immediately before the
court<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>&mdash;a practice habitual with Marshall and dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>tinguishing
him sharply from most jurists. The vessel
in controversy, owned by citizens of Maryland,
was, in 1810, captured by a French warship, armed,
and taken into the French service. The capture was
made under one of the decrees of Napoleon when the
war between Great Britain and France was raging
fiercely. This was the Rambouillet Decree of March
23, 1810, which because of the Non-Intercourse Act
of March 1, 1809, ordered that American ships, entering
French ports, be seized and sold.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> The following
year the Exchange, converted into a French
national war-craft under the name of the Balaou,
manned by a French crew, commanded by a French
captain, Dennis M. Begon, put into the port of
Philadelphia for repairs of injuries sustained in
stress of weather. The former owners of the vessel
libeled the ship, alleging that the capture was illegal
and demanding their property.</p>

<p>In due course this case came before Marshall who,
on March 3, 1812, delivered a long and exhaustive
opinion, the effect of which is that the question of
title to a ship having the character of a man-of-war is
not justiciable in the courts of another country. The
Chief Justice begins by avowing that he is "exploring
an unbeaten path" and must rely, mainly, on "general
principles." A nation's jurisdiction within its
own territory is "necessarily exclusive and absolute.
It is susceptible of no limitation not imposed by itself."
The nation itself must consent to any restrictions
upon its "full and complete power ... within
its own territories."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>Nations are "distinct sovereignties, possessing
equal rights and equal independence"; and, since
mutual intercourse is for mutual benefit, "all sovereigns
have consented" in certain cases to relax their
"absolute and complete jurisdiction within their respective
territories.... Common usage, and ... common
opinion growing out of that usage" may determine
whether such consent has been given.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Even
when a nation has not expressly stipulated to modify
its jurisdiction, it would be guilty of bad faith if
"suddenly and without previous notice" it violated
"the usages and received obligations of the civilized
world."</p>

<p>One sovereign is not "amenable" to another in
any respect, and "can be supposed to enter a foreign
territory only under an express license, or in the confidence
that the immunities belonging to his independent
sovereign station, though not expressly
stipulated, are reserved by implication, and will be
extended to him." From the facts that sovereigns
have "perfect equality and absolute independence,"
and that mutual intercourse and "an interchange of
good offices with each other" are to their common
advantage, flows a class of cases in which all sovereigns
are "understood to waive the exercise of a
part of that complete exclusive territorial jurisdiction"
which is "the attribute of every nation."</p>

<p>One of these cases "is admitted to be the exemption
of the person of the sovereign from arrest or
detention within a foreign territory. If he enters that
territory with the knowledge and license of its sover<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>eign,
that license, although containing no stipulation
exempting his person from arrest, is universally understood
to imply such stipulation."<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> The protection
of foreign ministers stands "on the same principles."
The governments to which they are accredited
need not expressly consent that these ministers shall
receive immunity, but are "supposed to assent to
it." This assent is implied from the fact that, "without
such exemption, every sovereign would hazard
his own dignity by employing a public minister
abroad.... Therefore, a consent to receive him, implies
a consent" that he shall be exempt from the
territorial jurisdiction of the nation to which he is
sent.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>The armies of one sovereign cannot pass through
the territory of another without express permission;
to do so would be a violation of faith. Marshall here
enters into the reasons for this obvious rule. But the
case is far otherwise, he says, as to "ships of war
entering the ports of a friendly power." The same
dangers and injuries do not attend the entrance of
such vessels into a port as are inseparable from the
march of an army through a country. But as to foreign
vessels, "if there be no prohibition," of which
notice has been given, "the ports of a friendly nation
are considered as open to the public ships of
all powers with whom it is at peace, and they are
supposed to enter such ports and to remain in them
while allowed to remain, under the protection of the
government of the place."<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Marshall goes into a long
examination of whether the rule applies to ships of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
war, and concludes that it does. So the Exchange,
now an armed vessel of France, rightfully came into
the port of Philadelphia and, while there, is under
the protection of the American Government.</p>

<p>In this situation can the title to the vessel be adjudicated
by American courts? It cannot, because the
schooner "must be considered as having come into
the American territory under an implied promise,
that while necessarily within it, and demeaning herself
in a friendly manner, she should be exempt from
the jurisdiction of the country."<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>Over this general question there was much confusion
and wrangling in the courts of various countries,
but Marshall's opinion came to be universally
accepted, and is the foundation of international law
on that subject as it stands to-day.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>Scarcely any other judicial act of Marshall's life
reveals so clearly his moral stature and strength.
He was, as he declared, "exploring an unbeaten
path," and could have rendered a contrary decision,
sustaining it with plausible arguments. Had he
allowed his feelings to influence his judgment; had
he permitted his prejudices to affect his reason; had
he heeded the desires of political friends&mdash;his opinion
in the case of the Exchange would have been the
reverse of what it was.</p>

<p>In the war then desolating Europe, he was an intense
partisan of Great Britain and bitterly hostile
to France.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> He hated Napoleon with all the vigor
of his being. He utterly disapproved of what he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
believed to be the Administration's truckling, or, at
least, partiality, to the Emperor. Yet here was a
ship, captured from Americans under the orders of
that "satanic" ruler, a vessel armed by him and in
his service. The emotions of John Marshall must
have raged furiously; but he so utterly suppressed
them that clear reason and considerations of statesmanship
alone controlled him.</p>

<p>In the South American revolutions against Spain,
American sailors generally and, indeed, the American
people as a whole, ardently sympathized with
those who sought to establish for themselves free
and independent governments. Often American seamen
took active part in the conflicts. On one such
occasion three Yankee mariners, commissioned by
the insurrectionary government of one of the revolting
provinces, attacked a Spanish ship on the high
seas, overawed the crew, and removed a large and
valuable cargo. The offending sailors were indicted
and tried in the United States Court for the District
of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Upon the many questions arising in this case,
United States <i>vs.</i> Palmer,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> the judges, Story of the
Supreme Court, and John Davis, District Judge,
disagreed and these questions were certified to the
Supreme Court for decision. One of these questions
was: What, in international law, is the status of a
revolting province during civil war?<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> In an extended
and closely reasoned opinion, largely devoted
to the construction of the act of Congress on piracy,
the Chief Justice lays down the rule that the relation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
of the United States to parts of countries engaged in
internecine war is a question which must be determined
by the political departments of the Government
and not by the Judicial Department. Questions
of this kind "belong ... to those who can declare
what the law shall be; who can place the nation in
such a position with respect to foreign powers as to
their own judgment shall appear wise; to whom are
entrusted all its foreign relations.... In such contests
a nation may engage itself with the one party or the
other; may observe absolute neutrality; may recognize
the new state absolutely; or may make a limited
recognition of it.</p>

<p>"The proceeding in courts must depend so entirely
on the course of the government, that it is difficult
to give a precise answer to questions which do not
refer to a particular nation. It may be said, generally,
that if the government remains neutral, and recognizes
the existence of a civil war, its courts cannot
consider as criminal those acts of hostility which
war authorizes, and which the new government may
direct against its enemy. To decide otherwise, would
be to determine that the war prosecuted by one of
the parties was unlawful, and would be to arraign
the nation to which the court belongs against that
party. This would transcend the limits prescribed
to the judicial department."<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> So the Yankee "liberators"
were set free.</p>

<p>Another instance of the haling of American citizens
before the courts of the United States for having
taken part in the wars of South American coun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>tries
for liberation was the case of the Divina Pastora.
This vessel was captured by a privateer manned and
officered by Americans in the service of the United
Provinces of Rio de la Plata. An American prize
crew was placed on board the Spanish vessel which
put into the port of New Bedford in stress of weather
and was there libeled by the Spanish Consul. The
United States District Court awarded restitution,
the Circuit Court affirmed this decree, and the case
was appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Marshall held that the principle announced in the
Palmer case governed the question arising from the
capture of the Divina Pastora. "The United States,
having recognized the existence of a civil war between
Spain and her colonies, but remaining neutral,
the courts of the Union are bound to consider as lawful
those acts which war authorizes." Captures by
privateers in the service of the revolting colonies are
"regarded by us as other captures, jure belli, are regarded,"
unless our neutral rights or our laws or
treaties are violated.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>The liberal statesman and humanitarian in Marshall
on matters of foreign policy is often displayed in
his international utterances. In the case of the Venus,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
he dissented from the harsh judgment of the majority
of the court, which clearly stated the cold law as
it existed at the time, "that the property of an American
citizen domiciled in a foreign country became,
on the breaking out of war with that country, immediately
confiscable as enemy's property, even
though it was shipped before he had knowledge of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the war."<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> Surely, said Marshall, that rule ought
not to apply to a merchant who, when war breaks
out, intends to leave the foreign country where he
has been doing business. Whether or not his property
is enemy property depends not alone on his residence
in the enemy country, but also on his intention
to remain after war begins. But it is plain that evidence
of his intention can seldom, if ever, be given
during peace and that it can be furnished only "after
the war shall be known to him." Of consequence,
"justice requires that subsequent testimony shall be
received to prove a pre-existing fact."<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>It is not true that extended residence in a foreign
country in time of peace is evidence of intention to
remain there permanently. "The stranger merely
residing in a country during peace, however long
his stay, ... cannot ... be considered as incorporated
into that society, so as, immediately on a declaration
of war, to become the enemy of his own."<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> Even
the ancient writers on international law concede this
principle. But modern commerce has sensibly influenced
international law and greatly strengthened
the common sense and generally accepted considerations
just mentioned. All know, as a matter of everyday
experience, that "merchants, while belonging
politically to one society, are considered commercially
as the members of another."<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> The real motives
of the merchant should be taken into account.</p>

<p>Of the many cases in which Marshall rendered
opinions touching upon international law, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
that of the Nereid<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> is perhaps the best known. The
descriptions of the arguments in that controversy,
and of the court when they were being made, are the
most vivid and accurate that have been preserved
of the Supreme Bench and the attorneys who practiced
before it at that time. Because of this fact an
account of the hearing in this celebrated case will
be helpful to a realization of similar scenes.</p>

<p>The burning of the Capitol by the British in 1814
left the Supreme Court without its basement room
in that edifice; at the time the case of the Nereid
was heard, and for two years afterward,<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> that tribunal
held its sessions in the house of Elias Boudinot
Caldwell, the clerk of the court, on Capitol Hill.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
Marshall and the Associate Justices sat "inconveniently
at the upper end" of an uncomfortable room
"unfit for the purpose for which it is used."<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> In the
space before the court were the counsel and other
lawyers who had gathered to hear the argument.
Back of them were the spectators. On the occasion
of this hearing, the room was well filled by members
of the legal profession and by laymen, for everybody
looked forward to a brilliant legal debate.</p>

<p>Nor were these expectations vain. The question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
was as to whether a certain cargo owned by neutrals,
but found in an enemy ship, should be restored. The
claimants were represented by J. Ogden Hoffman
of New York and the universally known and talked
of Thomas Addis Emmet, the Irish patriot whose pathetic
experiences, not less than his brilliant talents,
appealed strongly to Americans of that day. For the
captors appeared Alexander J. Dallas of Pennsylvania
and that strangest and most talented advocate
of his time, William Pinkney of Maryland,
exquisite dandy and profound lawyer,<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> affected fop
and accomplished diplomat, insolent as he was able,
haughty<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> as he was learned.</p>

<p>George Ticknor gives a vivid description of the
judges and lawyers. Marshall's neglected clothing
was concealed by his flowing black robes, and his unkempt
hair was combed, tied, and "fully powdered."
The Associate Justices were similarly robed and
powdered, and all "looked dignified." Justice Bushrod
Washington, "a little sharp-faced gentleman
with only one eye, and a profusion of snuff distributed
over his face," did not, perhaps, add to the
impressive appearance of the tribunal; but the noble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
features and stately bearing of William Johnson,
the handsome face and erect attitude of young
Joseph Story, and the bald-headed, scholarly looking
Brockholst Livingston, sitting beside Marshall,
adequately filled in the picture of which he was the
center.</p>

<p>Opinions were read by Marshall and Story, but
evidently they bored the nervous Pinkney, who
"was very restless, frequently moved his seat, and,
when sitting, showed by the convulsive twitches of
his face how anxious he was to come to the conflict.
At last the judges ceased to read, and he sprang into
the arena like a lion who has been loosed by his keepers
on the gladiator that awaited him." This large,
stout man wore "corsets to diminish his bulk," used
"cosmetics ... to smooth and soften a skin growing
somewhat wrinkled and rigid with age," and dressed
"in a style which would be thought foppish in a
much younger man."<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> His harsh, unmusical voice,
grating and high in tone, no less than his exaggerated
fashionable attire, at first repelled; but these defects
were soon forgotten because of "his clear and forcible
manner" of speaking, "his powerful and commanding
eloquence, occasionally illuminated with
sparkling lights, but always logical and appropriate,
and above all, his accurate and discriminating law
knowledge, which he pours out with wonderful precision."<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">

</div>

<p>Aloof, affected, overbearing<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> as he was, Pinkney
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
overcame prejudice and compelled admiration "by
force of eloquence, logic and legal learning and by
the display of naked talent," testifies Ticknor, who
adds that Pinkney "left behind him ... all the public
speaking I had ever heard."<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Emmet, the Irish
exile, "older in sorrows than in years," with "an
appearance of premature age," and wearing a "settled
melancholy in his countenance," spoke directly
to the point and with eloquence as persuasive as that
of Pinkney was compelling.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Pinkney had insulted
Emmet in a previous argument, and Marshall was
so apprehensive that the Irish lawyer would now
attack his opponent that Justice Livingston had to
reassure the Chief Justice.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>The court was as much interested in the oratory
as in the arguments of the counsel. Story's letters
are rich in comment on the style and manner of
the leading advocates. At the hearing of a cause
at about the same time as that of the Nereid, he tells
his wife that Pinkney and Samuel Dexter of Massachusetts
"have called crowded houses; all the belles
of the city have attended, and have been entranced
for hours." Dexter was "calm, collected, and forcible,
appealing to the judgment." Pinkney, "vivacious,
sparkling, and glowing," although not "as
close in his logic as Mr. Dexter," but "step[ping]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
aside at will from the path, and strew[ing] flowers of
rhetoric around him."<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>The attendance of women at arguments before the
Supreme Court had as much effect on the performance
of counsel at this period as on the oratory
delivered in House and Senate. One of the belles
of Washington jotted down what took place on one
such occasion. "Curiosity led me, ... to join the
female crowd who throng the court room. A place
in which I think women have no business.... One
day Mr. Pinckney [<i>sic</i>] had finished his argument
and was just about seating himself when Mrs. Madison
and a train of ladies enter'd,&mdash;he recommenced,
went over the same ground, using fewer arguments,
but scattering more flowers. And the day I was
there I am certain he thought more of the female
part of his audience than of the court, and on concluding,
he recognized their presence, when he said,
'He would not weary the court, by going thro a long
list of cases to prove his argument, as it would not
only be fatiguing to them, but inimical to the laws
of good taste, which <i>on the present occasion</i>, (bowing
low) he wished to obey."<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>This, then, is a fairly accurate picture of the
Supreme Court of the United States when the great
arguments were made before it and its judgments
delivered through the historic opinions of Marshall&mdash;such
the conduct of counsel, the appearance of
the Justices, the auditors in attendance. Always,
then, when thinking of the hearings in the Supreme
Court while he was Chief Justice, we must bear in
mind some such scene as that just described.</p>

<p>William Pinkney, the incomparable and enigmatic,
passed away in time; but his place was taken
by Daniel Webster, as able if not so accomplished,
quite as interesting from the human point of view,
and almost as picturesque. The lively, virile Clay
succeeded the solid and methodical Dexter; and a
procession of other eminent statesmen files past our
eyes in the wake of those whose distinction for the
moment had persuaded their admirers that their
equals never would be seen again. It is essential to
an understanding of the time that we firmly fix in
our minds that the lawyers, no less than the judges,
of that day, were publicists as well as lawyers. They
were, indeed, statesmen, having deep in their minds
the well-being of their Nation even more than the
success of their clients.</p>

<p>Briefly stated, the facts in the case of the Nereid
were as follows: More than a year after our second
war with Great Britain had begun, one Manuel Pinto
of Buenos Aires chartered the heavily armed British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
merchant ship, the Nereid, to take a cargo from London
to the South American city and another back
to the British metropolis. The Nereid sailed under
the protection of a British naval convoy. The outgoing
cargo belonged partly to Pinto, partly to other
Spaniards, and partly to British subjects. When approaching
Madeira an American privateer attacked
the Nereid and, after a brief fight, captured the British
vessel and took her to New York as a prize. The
British part of the cargo was condemned without
contest. That part belonging to Pinto and the other
Spaniards was also awarded to the captors, but over
the earnest opposition of the owners, who appealed
to the Supreme Court. The arguments before the
Supreme Court were long and uncommonly able.
Those of Pinkney and Emmet, however, contained
much florid "eloquence."<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>Space permits no summary of these addresses; the
most that can be given here is the substance of Marshall's
very long and tedious opinion which is of no
historical interest, except that part of it dealing with
international law. The Chief Justice stated this capital
question: "Does the treaty between Spain and
the United States subject the goods of either party,
being neutral, to condemnation as enemy property,
if found by the other in a vessel of an enemy? That
treaty stipulates that neutral bottoms shall make
neutral goods, but contains no stipulation that enemy
bottoms shall communicate the hostile character
to the cargo. It is contended by the captors that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
two principles are so completely identified that the
stipulation of the one necessarily includes the other."</p>

<p>It was, said Marshall, "a part of the original law
of nations" that enemy goods in friendly vessels "are
prize of war," and that friendly goods in enemy vessels
must be restored if captured. The reason of this
rule was that "war gives a full right to capture the
goods of an enemy, but gives no right to capture
the goods of a friend." Just as "the neutral flag constitutes
no protection to enemy property," so "the
belligerent flag communicates no hostile character to
neutral property." The nature of the cargo, therefore,
"depends in no degree" upon the ship that
carries it.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>Unless treaties expressly modified this immemorial
law of nations there would, declared Marshall, "seem
to be no necessity" to suppose that an exception was
intended. "Treaties are formed upon deliberate reflection";
if they do not specifically designate that
a particular item is to be taken out of the "ancient
rule," it remains within it. "The agreement [in the
Spanish treaty] that neutral bottoms shall make neutral
goods is ... a concession made by the belligerent
to the neutral"; as such it is to be encouraged since
"it enlarges the sphere of neutral commerce, and
gives to the neutral flag a capacity not given to it
by the law of nations."</p>

<p>On the contrary, a treaty "stipulation which subjects
neutral property, found in the bottom of an enemy,
to condemnation as prize of war, is a concession
made by the neutral to the belligerent. It narrows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the sphere of neutral commerce, and takes from the
neutral a privilege he possessed under the law of nations."
However, a government can make whatever
contracts with another that it may wish to make.
"What shall restrain independent nations from
making such a compact" as they please?<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>Suppose that, regardless of "our treaty with Spain,
considered as an independent measure, the ordinances
of that government would subject American
property, under similar circumstances, to confiscation."
Ought Spanish property, for that reason, to be
"condemned as prize of war"? That was not a question
for courts to decide: "Reciprocating to the subjects
of a nation, or retaliating on them its unjust
proceedings towards our citizens, is a political, not a
legal measure. It is for the consideration of the government,
not of its courts. The degree and the kind
of retaliation depend entirely on considerations foreign
to this tribunal."</p>

<p>The Government is absolutely free to do what it
thinks best: "It is not for its courts to interfere with
the proceedings of the nation and to thwart its views.
It is not for us to depart from the beaten track prescribed
for us, and to tread the devious and intricate
path of politics." He and his associates had no difficulty,
said Marshall, in arriving at these conclusions.
"The line of partition" between "belligerent rights
and neutral privileges" is "not so distinctly marked
as to be clearly discernible."<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Nevertheless, the
neutral part of the Nereid's cargo must "be governed
by the principles which would apply to it had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the Nereid been a general ship." That she was armed,
that she fought to resist capture, did not charge the
cargo with the belligerency of the ship, since the
owners of the cargo had nothing to do with her
armed equipment or belligerent conduct.</p>

<p>It is "universally recognized as the original rule
of the law of nations" that a neutral may ship his
goods on a belligerent vessel. This right is "founded
on the plain and simple principle that the property
of a friend remains his property wherever it may be
found."<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> That it is lodged in an armed belligerent
ship does not take it out of this universal rule. The
plain truth is, declares Marshall, that "a belligerent
has a perfect right to arm in his own defense; and a
neutral has a perfect right to transport his goods
in a belligerent vessel." Such merchandise "does
not cease to be neutral" because placed on an armed
belligerent ship, nor when that vessel exercises the
undoubted belligerent right forcibly to resist capture
by the enemy.</p>

<p>Shipping goods on an armed belligerent ship does
not defeat or even impair the right of search. "What
is this right of search? Is it a substantive and independent
right wantonly, and in the pride of power,
to vex and harass neutral commerce, because there is
a capacity to do so?" No! It is a right "essential ...
to the exercise of ... a full and perfect right to capture
enemy goods and articles going to their enemy
which are contraband of war.... It is a mean justified
by the end," and "a right ... ancillary to the
greater right of capture."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>For a neutral to place "his goods in the vessel of an
armed enemy" does not connect him with that enemy
or give him a "hostile character." Armed or unarmed,
"it is the right and the duty of the carrier to
avoid capture and to prevent a search." Neither
arming nor resistance is "chargeable to the goods or
their owner, where he has taken no part" in either.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
Pinkney had cited two historical episodes, but Marshall
waved these aside as of no bearing on the case.
"If the neutral character of the goods is forfeited by
the resistance of the belligerent vessel, why is not the
neutral character of the passengers," who did not engage
in the conflict, "forfeited by the same cause?"<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>In the case of the Nereid, the goods of the neutral
shipper were inviolable. Pinkney had drawn a horrid
picture of the ship, partly warlike, partly peaceful,
displaying either character as safety or profit dictated.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
But, answers Marshall, falling into something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
like the rhetoric of his youth,<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> "the Nereid has not
that centaur-like appearance which has been ascribed
to her. She does not rove over the ocean hurling
the thunders of war while sheltered by the olive
branch of peace." Her character is not part neutral,
part hostile. "She is an open and declared belligerent;
claiming all the rights, and subject to all the
dangers of the belligerent character." One of these
rights is to carry neutral goods which were subject
to "the hazard of being taken into port" in case of
the vessel's capture&mdash;in the event of which they
would merely be "obliged to seek another conveyance."
The ship might lawfully be captured and
condemned; but the neutral cargo within it remained
neutral, could not be forfeited, and must be
returned to its owners.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>But Marshall anoints the wounds of the defeated
Pinkney with a tribute to the skill and beauty
of his oratory and argument: "With a pencil dipped
in the most vivid colors, and guided by the hand
of a master, a splendid portrait has been drawn exhibiting
this vessel and her freighter as forming a
single figure, composed of the most discordant materials
of peace and war. So exquisite was the skill
of the artist, so dazzling the garb in which the figure
was presented, that it required the exercise of that
cold investigating faculty which ought always to belong
to those who sit on this bench, to discover its
only imperfection; its want of resemblance."<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>Such are examples of Marshall's expositions of
international law and typical illustrations of his
method in statement and reasoning. His opinion in
the case of the Nereid is notable, too, because Story
dissented<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>&mdash;and for Joseph Story to disagree with
John Marshall was a rare event. Justice Livingston
also disagreed, and the British High Court of
Admiralty maintained the contrary doctrine. But
the principle announced by Marshall, that enemy
bottoms do not make enemy goods and that neutral
property is sacred, remained and still remains the
American doctrine. Indeed, by the Declaration of
Paris in 1856, the principle thus announced by Marshall
in 1815 is now the accepted doctrine of the
whole world.</p>

<p>Closely akin to the statesmanship displayed in his
pronouncements upon international law, was his assertion,
in Insurance Co. <i>vs.</i> Canter,<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> that the Nation
has power to acquire and to govern territory.
The facts of this case were that a ship with a cargo
of cotton, which was insured, was wrecked on the
coast of Florida after that territory had been ceded
to the United States and before it became a State of
the Union. The cotton was saved, and taken to Key
West, where, by order of a local court acting under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
a Territorial law, it was sold at auction to satisfy
claims for salvage. Part of the cotton was purchased
by one David Canter, who shipped it to Charleston,
South Carolina, where the insurance companies libeled
it. The libelants contended, among other
things, that the Florida court was not competent to
order the auction sale because the Territorial act
was "inconsistent" with the National Constitution.
After a sharp and determined contest in the District
and Circuit Courts of the United States at Charleston,
in which Canter finally prevailed, the case was
taken to the Supreme Court.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>Was the Territorial act, under which the local
court at Key West ordered the auction sale, valid?
The answer to that question, said Marshall, in delivering
the opinion of the court, depends upon "the
relation in which Florida stands to the United
States." Since the National Government can make
war and conclude treaties, it follows that it "possesses
the power of acquiring territory either by conquest
or treaty.... Ceded territory becomes a part
of the nation to which it is annexed"; but "the relations
of the inhabitants to each other [do not] undergo
any change." Their allegiance is transferred;
but the law "which regulates the intercourse and
general conduct of individuals remains in force until
altered by the newly created power of the state."<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>The treaty by which Spain ceded Florida to the
United States assures to the people living in that
Territory "the enjoyment of the privileges, rights,
and immunities" of American citizens; "they do not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
however, participate in political power; they do not
share in the government till Florida shall become
a state. In the meantime Florida continues to be a
Territory of the United States, governed by virtue
of that clause in the Constitution which empowers
Congress 'to make all needful rules &amp; regulations
respecting the territory or other property belonging
to the United States.'"<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>The Florida salvage act is not violative of the Constitution.
The courts upon which that law confers
jurisdiction are not "Constitutional Courts; ... they
are legislative Courts, created in virtue of the general
right of sovereignty which exists in the government,
or in virtue of that clause which enables
Congress to make all needful rules and regulations respecting
the territory belonging to the United States....
Although admiralty jurisdiction can be exercised,
in the States, in those courts only" which are authorized
by the Constitution, the same limitation
does not extend to the Territories. In legislating for
them, Congress exercises the combined powers of the
general and of a state government.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>Admirable and formative as were Marshall's opinions
of the law of nations, they received no attention
from the people, no opposition from the politicians,
and were generally approved by the bar. At the very
next term of the Supreme Court, after the decision
in the case of the Nereid, an opinion was delivered
by Story that aroused more contention and had
greater effect on the American Nation than had all
the decisions of the Supreme Court on international<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
law up to that time. This was the opinion in the
famous case of Martin <i>vs.</i> Hunter's Lessee.</p>

<p>It was Story's first exposition of Constitutional
law and it closely resembles Marshall's best interpretations
of the Constitution. So conspicuous is this
fact that the bench and bar generally have adopted
the view that the Chief Justice was, in effect, the
spiritual author of this commanding judicial utterance.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>
But Story had now been by Marshall's side
on the Supreme Bench for four years and, in his ardent
way, had become more strenuously Nationalist,
at least in expression, than Marshall.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>That the Chief Justice himself did not deliver this
opinion was due to the circumstance that his brother,
James M. Marshall, was involved in the controversy;
was, indeed, a real party in interest. This fact, together
with the personal hatred of Marshall by the
head of the Virginia Republican organization, had
much to do with the stirring events that attended
and followed this litigation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>At the time of the Fairfax-Hunter controversy,
Virginia was governed by one of the most efficient
party organizations ever developed under free institutions.
Its head was Spencer Roane, President of
the Court of Appeals, the highest tribunal in the
State, an able and learned man of strong prejudices
and domineering character. Jefferson had intended
to appoint Roane Chief Justice of the United States
upon the expected retirement of Ellsworth.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> But
Ellsworth's timely resignation gave Adams the opportunity
to appoint Marshall. Thus Roane's highest
ambition was destroyed and his lifelong dislike of
Marshall became a personal and a virulent animosity.</p>

<p>Roane was supported by his cousin, Thomas
Ritchie, editor of the Richmond <i>Enquirer</i>, the most
influential of Southern newspapers, and, indeed, one
of the most powerful journals in the Nation. Another
of the Virginia junto was John Taylor of Caroline
County, a brilliant, unselfish, and sincere man.
Back of this triumvirate was Thomas Jefferson with
his immense popularity and his unrivaled political
sagacity. These men were the commanding officers
of a self-perpetuating governmental system based
on the smallest political unit, the County Courts.
These courts were made up of justices of the peace
appointed by the Governor. Vacancies in the County
Courts were filled only on the recommendation of the
remaining members.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> These justices of the peace
also named the men to be sent to the State Legislature
which appointed the Governor and also chose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the members of the Court of Appeals who held office
for life.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> A perfect circle of political action was thus
formed, the permanent and controlling center of
which was the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p>These, then, were the judge, the court, and the
party organization which now defied the Supreme
Court of the United States. By one of those curious
jumbles by which Fate confuses mortals, the excuse
for this defiance of Nationalism by Localism arose
from a land investment by Marshall and his brother.
Thus the fact of the purchase of the larger part of
the Fairfax estate<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> is woven into the Constitutional
development of the Nation.</p>

<p>Five years before the Marshall syndicate made
this investment,<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> one David Hunter obtained from
Virginia a grant of seven hundred and eighty-eight
acres of that part of the Fairfax holdings known as
"waste and ungranted land."<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> The grant was made
under the various confiscatory acts of the Virginia
Legislature passed during the Revolution. These
acts had not been carried into effect, however, and
in 1783 the Treaty of Peace put an end to subsequent
proceedings under them.</p>

<p>Denny Martin Fairfax, the devisee of Lord Fairfax,
denied the validity of Hunter's grant from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
State on the ground that Virginia did not execute
her confiscatory statutes during the war, and that all
lands and property to which those laws applied were
protected by the Treaty of Peace. In 1791, two years
after he obtained his grant and eight years after the
ratification of the treaty, Hunter brought suit in
the Superior Court at Winchester<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> against Fairfax's
devisee for the recovery of the land. The action was
under the ancient form of legal procedure still practiced,
and bore the title of "Timothy Trititle, Lessee
of David Hunter, <i>vs.</i> Denny Fairfax," Devisee of
Thomas, Lord Fairfax.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> The facts were agreed to by
the parties and, on April 24, 1794, the court decided
against Hunter,<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> who appealed to the Court of Appeals
at Richmond.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> Two years later, in May, 1796,
the case was argued before Judges Roane, Fleming,
Lyons, and Carrington.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> Meanwhile the Jay Treaty
had been ratified, thus confirming the guarantees of
the Treaty of Peace to the holders of titles of lands
which Virginia, in her confiscatory acts, had declared
forfeited.</p>

<p>At the winter session, 1796-97, of the Virginia
Legislature, Marshall, acting for his brother and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
brother-in-law, as well as for himself, agreed to execute
deeds to relinquish their joint claims "to the
waste and unappropriated lands in the Northern
Neck" upon condition that the State would confirm
the Fairfax title to lands specifically appropriated<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
by Lord Fairfax or by his devisee. But for the statement
made many years later by Judges Roane and
Fleming, of the Court of Appeals, that this adjustment
covered the land claimed by Hunter, it would
appear that Marshall did not intend to include it in
the compromise,<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> even if, as seems improbable, it was
a part of the Marshall syndicate's purchase; for the
decision of the court at Winchester had been against
Hunter, and after that decision and before the compromise,
the Jay Treaty had settled the question of
title.</p>

<p>On October 18, 1806, the Marshall syndicate, having
finally made the remaining payments for that
part of the Fairfax estate purchased by it&mdash;fourteen
thousand pounds in all&mdash;Philip Martin, the devisee
of Denny M. Fairfax, executed his warranty to John
and James M. Marshall and their brother-in-law,
Rawleigh Colston; and this deed was duly recorded
in Fauquier, Warren, Frederick, and Shenandoah<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Counties, where the Fairfax lands were situated.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>
Nearly ten years before this conveyance, James M.
Marshall separately had purchased from Denny
Martin Fairfax large quantities of land in Shenandoah
and Hardy Counties where the Hunter grant
probably was situated.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>It would seem that James M. Marshall continued
in peaceful possession of the land, the title to which
the Winchester court had decreed to be in the Fairfax
devisee and not in Hunter. When Denny M. Fairfax
died, he devised his estate to his younger brother<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>
Major-General Philip Martin. About the same time
he made James M. Marshall his administrator, with
the will annexed, apparently for the purpose of enabling
him to collect old rents.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> For thirteen years
and six months the case of Hunter <i>vs.</i> Fairfax's Devisee
slumbered in the drowsy archives of the Virginia
Court of Appeals. In the autumn of 1809, however,
Hunter demanded a hearing of it and, on October
25, of that year, it was reargued.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> Hunter was represented
by John Wickham, then the acknowledged
leader of the Virginia bar, and by another lawyer
named Williams.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> Daniel Call appeared for the
Fairfax devisee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>The following spring<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> the Court of Appeals decided
in favor of Hunter, reversing the judgment of
the lower court rendered more than sixteen years
before. In his opinion Roane, revealing his animosity
to Marshall, declared that the compromise of 1796
covered the case. "I can never consent that the appellees,<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
after having got the benefit thereof, should
refuse to submit thereto, or pay the equivalent; the
consequence of which would be, that the Commonwealth
would have to remunerate the appellant for
the land recovered from him! Such a course cannot
be justified on the principles of justice and good
faith; and, I confess, I was not a little surprised
that the objection should have been raised in the
case before us."<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>To this judgment the Fairfax devisee<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> obtained
from the Supreme Court of the United States<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> a writ
of error to the Virginia court under Section 25 of
the Ellsworth Judiciary Act, upon the ground that
the case involved the construction of the Treaty of
Peace with Great Britain and the Jay Treaty, the
Virginia court having held against the right claimed
by Fairfax's devisee under those treaties.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>The Supreme Court now consisted of two Federalists,
Washington and Marshall, and five Republicans,
Johnson, Livingston, Story, and Duval; and
Todd, who was absent from illness at the decision
of this cause. Marshall declined to sit during the arguments,
or to participate in the deliberations and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
conclusions of his associates. Indeed, throughout
this litigation the Chief Justice may almost be said
to have leaned backward. It was with good reason
that Henry S. Randall, the biographer and apologist
of Jefferson, went out of his way to laud Marshall's
"stainless private character" and pay tribute to his
"austere public and private virtue."<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>Eight years before the Hunter-Fairfax controversy
was first brought to the Supreme Court, the
case of the Granville heirs against William R. Davie,
Nathaniel Allen, and Josiah Collins, was tried at the
June term, 1805, of the United States Court at
Raleigh, North Carolina. Marshall, as Circuit Judge,
sat with Potter, District Judge. The question was
precisely that involved in the Fairfax title. The
grant to Lord Granville<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> was the same as that to
Lord Fairfax.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> North Carolina had passed the same
confiscatory acts against alien holdings as Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>
Under these statutes, Davie, Allen, and Collins obtained
grants to parts of the Granville estate<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> identical
with that of Hunter to a part of the Fairfax
estate in Virginia.</p>

<p>Here was an excellent opportunity for Marshall
to decide the Fairfax controversy once and for all.
Nowhere was his reputation at that time higher than
in North Carolina, nowhere was he more admired
and trusted.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> That his opinion would have been ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>cepted
by the State authorities and acquiesced in by
the people, there can be no doubt.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> But the Chief
Justice flatly stated that he would take no part in
the trial because of an "opinion ... formed when he
was very deeply interested (alluding to the cause of
Lord Fairfax in Virginia). He could not consistently
with his duty and the delicacy he felt, give an opinion
in the cause."<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>The case of Fairfax's Devisee <i>vs.</i> Hunter's Lessee
was argued for the former by Charles Lee of Richmond
and Walter Jones of Washington, D.C.
Robert Goodloe Harper of Baltimore appeared for
Hunter. On both sides the argument was mainly
upon the effect on the Fairfax title of the Virginia
confiscatory laws; of the proceedings or failure to
proceed under them; and the bearing upon the
controversy of the two treaties with Great Britain.
Harper, however, insisted that the court consider
the statute of Virginia which set forth and confirmed
the Marshall compromise.</p>

<p>On March 15, 1813, Story delivered the opinion
of the majority of the court, consisting of himself and
Justices Washington, Livingston, Todd, and Duval.
Johnson, alone, dissented. Story held that, since
Virginia had not taken the prescribed steps to acquire
legal possession of the land before the Treaty of
Peace, the State could not do so afterward. "The
patent of the original plaintiff [Hunter] ... issued im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>providently
and passed no title whatever." To uphold
Virginia's grant to Hunter "would be selling
suits and controversies through the whole country."<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
It was not necessary, said Story, to consider the
Treaty of Peace, since "we are well satisfied that
the treaty of 1794<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> completely protects and confirms
the title of Denny Fairfax."<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>In his dissenting opinion Justice Johnson ignored
the "compromise" of 1796, holding that the grant by
the State to Hunter extinguished the right of Fairfax's
devisee.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> He concurred with Story and Washington,
however, in the opinion that, on the face of
the record, the case came within Section 25 of the
Judiciary Act; that, therefore, the writ of error had
properly issued, and that the title must be inquired
into before considering "how far the ... treaty ... is
applicable to it."<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> Accordingly the mandate of the
Supreme Court was directed to the judges of the Virginia
Court of Appeals, instructing them "to enter
judgment for the appellant, Philip Martin [the Fairfax
devisee]." Like all writs of the Supreme Court,
it was, of course, issued in the name of the Chief
Justice.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>Hot was the wrath of Roane and the other judges
of Virginia's highest court when they received this
order from the National tribunal at Washington.
At their next sitting they considered whether to
obey or to defy the mandate. They called in "the
members of the bar generally," and the question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
"was solemnly argued" at Richmond for six consecutive
days.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> On December 16, 1815, the decision
was published. The Virginia judges unanimously declined
to obey the mandate of the Supreme Court
of the United States. Each judge rendered a separate
opinion, and all held that so much of Section 25 of
the National Judiciary Act as "extends the appellate
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to this court, is
not in pursuance of the constitution of the United
States."<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>But it was not only the Virginia Court of Appeals
that now spoke; it was the entire Republican partisan
machine, intensively organized and intelligently
run, that brought its power to bear against the highest
tribunal of the Nation. Beyond all possible doubt,
this Republican organization, speaking through the
supreme judiciary of the State, represented public
sentiment, generally, throughout the Old Dominion.
Unless this political significance of the opinions of
the Virginia judges be held of higher value than
their legal quality, the account of this historic controversy
deserves no more than a brief paragraph
stating the legal point decided.</p>

<p>The central question was well set forth by Judge
Cabell thus: Even where the construction of a treaty
is involved in the final decision of a cause by the
highest court of a State, that decision being against
the title of the party claiming under the treaty, can
Congress "confer on the Supreme Court of the
United States, a power to <i>re-examine, by way of appeal
or writ of error, the decision of the state Court; to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
affirm or reverse that decision; and in case of reversal,
to command the state Court to enter and execute a judgment
different from that which it had previously rendered</i>?"<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>Every one of the judges answered in the negative.
The opinion of Judge Cabell was the ablest, and
stated most clearly the real issue raised by the Virginia
court. Neither State nor National Government
is dependent one upon the other, he said; neither can
act "<i>compulsively</i>" upon the other. Controversies
might arise between State and National Governments,
"yet the constitution has provided no umpire,
has erected no tribunal by which they shall be
settled." Therefore, the National court could not
oblige the State court to "enter a judgment not its
own."<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> The meaning of the National "Constitution,
laws and treaties, ... must, in cases coming before
State courts, be decided by the State Judges, <i>according
to their own judgments, and upon their own
responsibility</i>."<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> National tribunals belong to one
sovereignty; State tribunals to a different sovereignty&mdash;neither
is "<i>superior</i>" to the other; neither
can command or instruct the other.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>Grant that this interpretation of the Constitution
results in conflicts between State and Nation
and even deprives the "general government ... of
the power of executing its laws and treaties"; even
so, "the defects of our system of government must
be remedied, not by the judiciary, but by the sovereign
power of the people." The Constitution must
be amended by the people, not by judicial interpre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>tation;<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
yet Congress, in Section 25 of the Judiciary
Act, "attempts, in fact, to make the State Courts
<i>Inferior Federal Courts</i>." The appellate jurisdiction
conferred on the Supreme Court, and the word
"<i>supreme</i>" itself, had reference to inferior National
courts and not to State courts.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>Judge Roane's opinion was very long and discussed
extensively every phase of the controversy. He held
that, in giving National courts power over State
courts, Section 25 of the Ellsworth Judiciary Act
violated the National Constitution. If National
courts could control State tribunals, it would be a
"plain case of the judiciary of one government correcting
and reversing the decisions of that of another."<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
The Virginia Court of Appeals "is bound,
to follow its own convictions ... any thing in the
decisions, or supposed decisions, of any other court,
to the contrary notwithstanding." Let the court at
Winchester, therefore, be instructed to execute the
judgment of the State Court of Appeals.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>Such was the open, aggressive, and dramatic defiance
of the Supreme Court of the United States
by the Court of Appeals of Virginia. Roane showed
his opinion to Monroe, who approved it and sent it
to Jefferson at Monticello. Jefferson heartily commended
Roane,<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> whereat the Virginia judge was
"very much flattered and gratified."<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p>Promptly Philip Martin, through James M. Marshall,
took the case to the Supreme Court by means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
of another writ of error. It now stood upon the
docket of that court as Martin <i>vs.</i> Hunter's Lessee.
Again Marshall refused to sit in the case. St. George
Tucker of Virginia, one of the ablest lawyers of the
South, and Samuel Dexter, the leader of the Massachusetts
bar, appeared for Hunter.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> As Harper had
done on the first appeal, both Tucker and Dexter
called attention to the fact that the decision of the
Virginia Court of Appeals did not rest exclusively
upon the Treaty of Peace, which alone in this case
would have authorized an appeal to the Supreme
Court.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>Story delivered the court's opinion, which was one
of the longest and ablest he ever wrote. The Constitution
was not ordained by the States, but "emphatically
... by 'the people of the United States.'<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>...
Its powers are expressed in general terms, leaving to
the legislature, from time to time, to adopt its own
means to effectuate legitimate objects, and to mold
and model the exercise of its powers, as its own
wisdom and the public interests should require."<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>
Story then quotes Sections 1 and 2 of Article III of
the Constitution,<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> and continues: Thus is "the voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
of the whole American people solemnly declared, in
establishing one great department of that government
which was, in many respects, national, and in
all, supreme." Congress cannot disregard this Constitutional
mandate. At a length which, but for the
newness of the question, would be intolerable, Story
demonstrates that the Constitutional grant of judiciary
powers is "imperative."<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>What, then, is the "nature and extent of the appellate
jurisdiction of the United States"? It embraces
"every case ... not exclusively to be decided by way
of original jurisdiction." There is nothing in the
Constitution to "restrain its exercise over state
tribunals in the enumerated cases.... It is the case, ...
and not the court, that gives the jurisdiction."<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> If
the appellate power does not extend to State courts
having concurrent jurisdiction of specified cases, then
that power does "not extend to all, but to some,
cases"&mdash;whereas the Constitution declares that it
extends to all other cases than those over which the
Supreme Court is given original jurisdiction.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>With great care Story shows the "propriety" of
this construction.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> Then, with repetitiousness after
the true Marshall pattern, he reasserts that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Constitution acts on States as well as upon individuals,
and gives many instances where the "sovereignty"
of the States are "restrained." State judges
are not independent "in respect to the powers
granted to the United States";<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> and the appellate
power of the Nation extends to the State courts in
cases prescribed in Section 25 of the Judiciary Act;
for the Constitution does not limit this power and
"we dare not interpose a limitation where the people
have not been disposed to create one."<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p>The case decided on the former record, says Story,
is not now before the court. "The question now litigated
is not upon the construction of a treaty, but
upon the constitutionality of a statute of the United
States, which is clearly within our jurisdiction."
However, "from motives of a public nature," the
Supreme Court would "re-examine" the grounds
of its former decision.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> After such re&euml;xamination,
extensive in length and detail, he finds the
first decision of the Supreme Court to have been
correct.</p>

<p>Story thus notices the Marshall adjustment of
1796: "If it be true (as we are informed)" that the
compromise had been effected, the court could not
take "judicial cognizance" of it "unless spread
upon the record." Aside from the Treaty of Peace,
the Fairfax title "was, at all events, perfect under
the treaty of 1794."<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> In conclusion, Story announces:
"It is the opinion of the whole court that the judgment
of the Court of Appeals of Virginia, rendered
on the mandate in this cause, be reversed, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
judgment of the District Court, held at Winchester,
be, and the same is hereby affirmed."<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>It has been commonly supposed that Marshall
practically dictated Story's two opinions in the Fairfax-Hunter
controversy, and certain writers have
stated this to be the fact. As we have seen, Story
himself, fifteen years afterwards, declared that the
Chief Justice had "concurred in every word of the
second opinion"; yet in a letter to his brother concerning
the effect of Story's opinion upon another
suit in the State court at Winchester, involving the
same question, Marshall says: "The case of Hunter
&amp; Fairfax is very absurdly put on the treaty of 94."<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Justice Johnson dissented in an opinion as inept
and unhappy as his dissent in Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>
He concurs in the judgment of his brethren, but, in
doing so, indulges in a stump speech in which
Nationalism and State Rights are mingled in astounding
fashion. The Supreme Court of the United
States, he says, "disavows all intention to decide on
the right to issue compulsory process to the state
courts." To be sure, the Supreme Court is "supreme
over persons and cases as far as our judicial powers
extend," but it cannot assert "any compulsory control
over the state tribunals." He views "this question
as one ... which may affect, in its consequences,
the permanence of the American Union," since the
Nation and "one of the greatest states" are in collision.
The "general government must cease to
exist" if the Virginia doctrine shall prevail, but "so
firmly" was he "persuaded that the American people
can no longer enjoy the blessings of a free government,
whenever the state sovereignties shall be prostrated
at the feet of the general government," that
he "could borrow the language of a celebrated orator,
and exclaim: 'I rejoice that Virginia has resisted.'"<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Nevertheless, Johnson agrees with the judgment
of his associates and, in doing so, delivers a Nationalist
opinion, stronger if possible than that of
Story.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>The public benefits and the historic importance of
the decision was the assertion of the supremacy
of the Supreme Court of the Nation over the highest
court of any State in all cases where the National
Constitution, laws and treaties&mdash;"the supreme law
of the land"&mdash;are involved. The decision of the
Supreme Court in Martin <i>vs.</i> Hunter's Lessee went
further than any previous judicial pronouncement
to establish the relation between National courts
and State tribunals which now exists and will continue
as long as the Republic endures.</p>

<p>When the news of this, the first Constitutional
opinion ever delivered by Story, got abroad, he was
mercilessly assailed by his fellow Republicans as a
"renegade."<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Congress refused to increase the salaries
of the members of the Supreme Court,<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> who found
it hard to live on the compensation allowed them,<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
and Story seriously considered resigning from the
bench and taking over the Baltimore practice of
Mr. Pinkney, who soon was to be appointed Minister<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
to Russia.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> The decision aroused excitement and indignation
throughout Virginia. Roane's popularity
increased from the Tide Water to the Valley.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> The
Republican organization made a political issue of
the judgment of the National tribunal at Washington.
Judge Roane issued his orders to his political
lieutenants. The party newspapers, led by the <i>Enquirer</i>,
inveighed against the "usurpation" by this
distant Supreme Court of the United States, a foreign
power, an alien judiciary, unsympathetic with
Virginia, ignorant of the needs of Virginians.</p>

<p>This conflict between the Supreme Court of the
United States and the Court of Appeals of Virginia
opened another phase of that fundamental struggle
which war was to decide&mdash;a fact without knowledge
of which this phase of American Constitutional
history is colorless.</p>

<p>Not yet, however, was the astute Virginia Republican
triumvirate ready to unloose the lightnings of
Virginia's wrath. That must be done only when the
whole South should reach a proper degree of emotion.
This time was not long to be delayed. Within
three years Marshall's opinion in M'Culloch <i>vs</i>.
Maryland was to give Roane, Ritchie, and Taylor
their cue to come upon the stage as the spokesmen
of Virginia and the entire South, as the champions,
indeed, of Localism everywhere throughout
America. Important were the parts they played in
the drama of Marshall's judicial career.</p>

autobiography: "I have ever considered the embargo a measure, which
went to the utmost limit of constructive power under the Constitution.
It stands upon the extreme verge of the Constitution, being in
its very form and terms an unlimited prohibition, or suspension of
foreign commerce." (Story, <span class="smcap">i</span>, 185-86.) When it is remembered that
after Story was made Associate Justice his views became identical
with those of Marshall on almost every subject, it would seem likely
that Story expressed the opinions of the Chief Justice as well as his
own on the constitutionality of the Embargo.</p></div>

Pinkney especially would become eloquent, even in an argument
of dry, commercial law, if women entered the court-room. "There
were ladies present&mdash;and Pinkney was expected to be eloquent at all
events. So, the mode he adopted was to get into his tragical tone in
discussing the construction of an act of Congress. Closing his speech
in this solemn tone he took his seat, saying to me, with a smile&mdash;'that
will do for the ladies.'" (Wirt to Gilmer, April 1, 1816, Kennedy,

The presence of women affected others no less than Pinkney.

hundred settlers or squatters (mostly Germans) on the wild lands who
petitioned the Legislature to establish title in them. David Hunter was
not one of these petitioners. Marshall agreed to execute deeds "extinguishing"
the Fairfax title "so soon as the conveyance shall be
transmitted to me from Mr. Fairfax." (Marshall to the Speaker of the
House of Delegates, Va., Nov. 24, 1796. See vol. <span class="smcap">ii</span>, footnote to 209,
of this work.) The Fairfax deed to the Marshalls was not executed
until ten years after this compromise. (Land Causes, 1833, 40, Records
in Office of Clerk of Circuit Court, Fauquier Co., Va.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_376_376" id="Footnote_376_376"></a><a href="#FNanchor_376_376"><span class="label">[376]</span></a> Two years later, on October 5, 1808, the Marshall brothers effected
a partition of the estate between themselves on the one part
and their brother-in-law on the other part, the latter receiving about
forty thousand acres. (Deed Book 36, 302, Records in Office of Clerk
of Circuit Court, Frederick Co., Va.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_377_377" id="Footnote_377_377"></a><a href="#FNanchor_377_377"><span class="label">[377]</span></a> On August 30, 1797, Denny Martin Fairfax conveyed to James M.
Marshall all the Fairfax lands in Virginia "save and except ... the
manor of Leeds." (See Marshall <i>vs.</i> Conrad, 5 Call, 364.) Thereafter
James M. Marshall lived in Winchester for several years and made
many conveyances of land in Shenandoah and Berkeley Counties.
For instance, Nov. 12, 1798, to Charles Lee, Deed Book 3, 634,
Records in Office of Clerk of Circuit Court, Frederick County, Va.;
Jan. 9, 1799, to Henry Richards, <i>ib.</i> 549; Feb. 4, 1799, to Joseph Baker,
Deed Book 25, <i>ib.</i> 561; March 30, 1799, to Richard Miller, Deed
Book 3, <i>ib.</i> 602, etc.
</p><p>
All of these deeds by James M. Marshall and Hester, his wife, recite
that these tracts and lots are parts of the lands conveyed to James
M. Marshall by Denny Martin Fairfax on August 30, 1797. John Marshall
does not join in any of these deeds. Apparently, therefore, he had
no personal interest in the tract claimed by Hunter.
</p><p>
In a letter to his brother Marshall speaks of the Shenandoah lands
as belonging to James M. Marshall: "With respect to the rents due
Denny Fairfax before the conveyance to you I should suppose a recovery
could only be defeated by the circumstance that they passed
to you by the deed conveying the land." (Marshall to his brother,
Feb. 13, 1806, MS.)
</p><p>
At the time when the Fairfax heir, Philip Martin, executed a deed
to the Marshall brothers and Rawleigh Colston, conveying to them the
Manor of Leeds, the lands involved in the Hunter case had been owned
by James M. Marshall exclusively for nearly ten years.
</p><p>
After the partition with Colston, October 5, 1808, John and James
M. Marshall, on September 5, 1809, made a partial division between
themselves of Leeds Manor, and Goony Run Manor in Shenandoah
County, the latter going to James M. Marshall.
</p><p>
These records apparently establish the facts that the "compromise"
of 1796 was not intended to include the land claimed by Hunter; that
James M. Marshall personally owned most of the lands about
Winchester; and that John Marshall had no personal interest whatever in
the land in controversy in the litigation under review.
</p><p>
This explains the refusal of the Supreme Court, including even
Justice Johnson, to take notice of the compromise of 1796. (See
<i>infra</i>, 157.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_381_381" id="Footnote_381_381"></a><a href="#FNanchor_381_381"><span class="label">[381]</span></a> It should be repeated that David Hunter was not one of the destitute
settlers who appealed to the Legislature in 1796. From the records
it would appear that he was a very prosperous farmer and land-owner
who could well afford to employ the best legal counsel, as he did
throughout the entire litigation. As early as 1771 we find him selling
to Edward Beeson 536 acres of land in Frederick County. (Deed Book
15, 213, Office of Clerk of Circuit Court, Frederick County, Va.) The
same Hunter also sold cattle, farming implements, etc., to a large
amount. (Deeds dated Nov. 2, 1771, Deed Book cited above, 279, 280.)
</p><p>
These transactions took place eighteen years before Hunter secured
from Virginia the grant of Fairfax lands, twenty-five years before the
Marshall compromise of 1796, thirty-eight years before Hunter employed
Wickham to revive his appeal against the Fairfax devisee, forty-two
years prior to the first arguments before the Supreme Court, and
forty-five years before the final argument and decision of the famous
case of Martin <i>vs.</i> Hunter's Lessee. So, far from being a poor, struggling,
submissive, and oppressed settler, David Hunter was one of
the most well-to-do, acquisitive, determined, and aggressive men in
Virginia.</p></div>

that Marshall was personally interested in the case; as we have
seen, he was not. There was of record but one appellee, the Fairfax
devisee.</p></div>

</p><p>
The last two lines of Roane's language are not clear, but it would
seem that the "objection" must have been that the Marshall compromise
did not include the land claimed by Hunter and others, the
title to which had been adjudged to be in Fairfax's devisee before the
compromise. This is, indeed, probably the meaning of the sentence
of Roane's opinion; otherwise it is obscure. It would appear certain
that the Fairfax purchasers did make just this objection. Certainly
they would have been foolish not to have done so if the Hunter land
was not embraced in the compromise.</p></div>

David Stone to the Legislature of North Carolina in which he devotes
much space to the Granville litigation and recommends "early provision
to meet the justice of the claim of her [North Carolina's] citizens
for remuneration in case of a decision against the sufficiency of the
title derived from herself." The "possibility" of such a decision is apparent
"when it is generally understood that a greatly and deservedly
distinguished member of that [the Supreme] Court, has already formed
an unfavorable opinion, will probably enforce the consideration that
it is proper to make some eventual provision, by which the purchasers
from the State, and those holding under that purchase, may
have justice done them." (Connor in <i>Univ. of Pa. Law Rev.</i> vol. 62,
690-91.)
</p><p>
From this message of Governor Stone it is clear that the State expected
a decision in favor of the Granville heirs, and that the Legislature
and State authorities were preparing to submit to that decision.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_395_395" id="Footnote_395_395"></a><a href="#FNanchor_395_395"><span class="label">[395]</span></a> <i>Raleigh Register</i>, June 24, 1805, as quoted by Connor in <i>Univ. of
Pa. Law Rev.</i> vol. 62, 689.
</p><p>
The jury found against the Granville heirs. A Mr. London, the
Granville agent at Wilmington, still hoped for success: "The favorable
sentiments of Judge Marshall encourage me to hope that we shall
finally succeed," he writes William Gaston, the Granville counsel.
Nevertheless, "I think the Judge's reasons for withdrawing from the
cause partakes more of political acquiescence than the dignified, official
independence we had a right to expect from his character. He
said enough to convince our opponents he was unfavorable to their
construction of the law and, therefore, should not have permitted incorrect
principles to harass our clients and create expensive delays.
Mr. Marshall had certainly no interest in our cause, he ought to have
governed the proceedings of a Court over which he presided, according
to such opinion&mdash;it has very much the appearance of shirking to popular
impressions."
</p><p>
London ordered an appeal to be taken to the Supreme Court of the
United States, remarking that "it is no doubt much in our favor what
has already dropt from the Chief Justice." (London to Gaston, July 8,
1805, as quoted by Connor in <i>Univ. of Pa. Law Rev.</i> vol. 62, 690.)
</p><p>
He was, however, disgusted with Marshall. "I feel much chagrin
that we are put to so much trouble and expense in this business, and
which I fear is in great degree to be attributed to the Chief Justice's
delivery." (Same to same, April 19, 1806, as quoted by Connor in <i>ib.</i>
691.)
</p><p>
For more than ten years the appeal of the Granville heirs from the
judgment of the National Court for the District of North Carolina reposed
on the scanty docket of the Supreme Court awaiting call for argument
by counsel. Finally on February 4, 1817, on motion of counsel
for the Granville heirs, the case was stricken from the docket. The
reason for this action undoubtedly was that William Gaston, counsel
for the Granville heirs, had been elected to Congress, was ambitious
politically, was thereafter elected judge of the Supreme Court of North
Carolina; none of these honors could possibly have been achieved had
he pressed the Granville case.</p></div>

</p><p>
Parts of this long letter are of interest: "Although Judge White [of
the Winchester court] will, of course, conform to the decision of the
court of appeals against the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme
court, &amp; therefore deny that the opinion in the case of Fairfax &amp; Hunter
is binding, yet he must admit that the supreme court is the proper
tribunal for expounding the treaties of the United States, &amp; that its
decisions on a treaty are binding on the state courts, whether they
possess the appellate jurisdiction or not.... The exposition of any state
law by the courts of that state, are considered in the courts of all
the other states, and in those of the United States, as a correct exposition,
not to be reexamined.
</p><p>
"The only exception to this rule is when the statute of a state is
supposed to violate the constitution of the United States, in which
case the courts of the Union claim a controuling &amp; supervising power.
Thus any construction made by the courts of Virginia on the statute
of descents or of distribution, or on any other subject, is admitted as
conclusive in the federal courts, although those courts might have decided
differently on the statute itself. The principle is that the courts
of every government are the proper tribunals for construing the legislative
acts of that government.
</p><p>
"Upon this principle the Supreme court of the United States, independent
of its appellate jurisdiction, is the proper tribunal for construing
the laws &amp; treaties of the United States; and the construction
of that court ought to be received every where as the right construction.
The Supreme court of the United States has settled the
construction of the treaty of peace to be that lands at that time held by
British subjects were not escheatable or grantable by a state.... I refer
particularly to Smith v The State of Maryland 6th Cranch Jackson v
Clarke 3 Wheaton &amp; Orr v Hodgson 4 Wheaton. The last case is explicit
&amp; was decided unanimously, Judge Johnson assenting.
</p><p>
"This being the construction of the highest court of the government
which is a party to the treaty is to be considered by all the world as its
true construction unless Great Britain, the other party, should controvert
it. The court of appeals has not denied this principle. The
dicta of Judge Roane respecting the treaty were anterior to this constitutional
construction of it."</p></div>

<h3>FINANCIAL AND MORAL CHAOS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Like a dropsical man calling out for water, water, our deluded citizens are
calling for more banks. (Jefferson.)</p>

<p>Merchants are crumbling to ruin, manufactures perishing, agriculture stagnating
and distress universal. (John Quincy Adams.)</p>

<p>If we can believe our Democratic editors and public declaimers it [Bank of the
United States] is a Hydra, a Cerberus, a Gorgon, a Vulture, a Viper.

<p>Where one prudent and honest man applies for [bankruptcy] one hundred

<p>Merchants and traders are harassed by twenty different systems of laws, prolific
in endless frauds, perjuries and evasions. (Harrison Gray Otis.)</p></div>


<p>The months of February and March, 1819, are memorable
in American history, for during those months
John Marshall delivered three of his greatest opinions.
All of these opinions have had a determinative
effect upon the political and industrial evolution of
the people; and one of them<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> has so decisively influenced
the growth of the Nation that, by many, it
is considered as only second in importance to the
Constitution itself. At no period and in no land,
in so brief a space of time, has any other jurist or
statesman ever bestowed upon his country three
documents of equal importance. Like the other fundamental
state papers which, in the form of judicial
opinions, Marshall gave out from the Supreme
Bench, those of 1819 were compelled by grave and
dangerous conditions, National in extent.</p>

<p>It was a melancholy prospect over which Marshall's
broad vision ranged, when from his rustic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
bench under his trees at Richmond, during the
spring and autumn of 1818, he surveyed the situation
in which the American people found themselves.
It was there, or in the quiet of the Blue Ridge Mountains
where he spent the summer months, that he
formed the outlines of those charts which he was soon
to present to the country for its guidance; and it was
there that at least one of them was put on paper.</p>

<p>The interpretation of John Marshall as the constructing
architect of American Nationalism is not
satisfactorily accomplished by a mere statement of
his Nationalist opinions and of the immediate legal
questions which they answered. Indeed, such a narrative,
by itself, does not greatly aid to an understanding
of Marshall's immense and enduring achievements.
Not in the narrow technical points involved,
some of them diminutive and all uninviting in their
formality; not in the dreary records of the law cases
decided, is to be found the measure of his monumental
service to the Republic or the meaning of
what he did. The state of things which imperatively
demanded the exercise of his creative genius and the
firm pressure of his steadying hand must be understood
in order to grasp the significance of his labors.</p>

<p>When the Supreme Court met in February, 1819,
almost the whole country was in grievous turmoil;
for nearly three years conditions had been growing
rapidly worse and were now desperate. Poverty,
bankruptcy, chicanery, crime were widespread and
increasing. Thrift, prudence, honesty, and order
had seemingly been driven from the hearts and minds
of most of the people; while speculation, craft, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
unscrupulous devices were prevalent throughout all
but one portion of the land. Only New England had
largely escaped the universal curse that appeared to
have fallen upon the United States; and even that
section was not untouched by the economic and
social plague that had raged and was becoming more
deadly in every other quarter.</p>

<p>While it is true that a genuine democratizing evolution
was in progress, this fact does not explain the
situation that had grown up throughout the country.
Neither does the circumstance that the development
of land and resources was going forward in haphazard
fashion, at the hands of a new population hard
pressed for money and facilities for work and communication,
reveal the cause of the appalling state
of affairs. It must frankly be said of the conditions,
to us now unbelievable, that they were due partly to
the ignorance, credulity, and greed of the people;
partly to the spirit of extravagance; partly to the
criminal avarice of the financially ambitious; partly
to popular dread of any great centralized moneyed
institution, however sound; partly to that pest of all
democracies, the uninformed and incessant demagogue
whipping up and then pandering to the passions
of the multitude; partly to that scarcely less
dangerous creature in a Republic, the fanatical doctrinaire,
proclaiming the perfection of government
by word-logic and insisting that human nature shall
be confined in the strait-jacket of verbal theory.
From this general welter of moral and economic debauchery,
Localism had once more arisen and was
eagerly reasserting its domination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>The immediate cause of the country's plight was
an utter chaos in banking. Seldom has such a financial
motley ever covered with variegated rags the
backs of a people. The confusion was incredible;
but not for a moment did the millions who suffered,
blame themselves for their tragic predicament. Now
praising banks as unfailing fountains of money, now
denouncing banks as the sources of poisoned waters,
clamoring for whatever promised even momentary
relief, striking at whatever seemingly denied it, the
people laid upon anything and anybody but themselves
and their improvidence, the responsibility for
their distress.</p>

<p>Hamilton's financial plans<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> had proved to be as
successful as they were brilliant. The Bank of the
United States, managed, on the whole, with prudence,
skill, and honesty,<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> had fulfilled the expectations
of its founders. It had helped to maintain the
National credit by loans in anticipation of revenue;
it had served admirably, and without compensation,
as an agent for collecting, safeguarding, and transporting
the funds of the Government; and, more
important than all else, it had kept the currency,
whether its own notes or those of private banks, on
a sound specie basis. It had, indeed, "acted as the
general guardian of commercial credit" and, as such,
had faithfully and wisely performed its duties.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>But the success of the Bank had not overcome the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
original antagonism to a great central moneyed institution.
Following the lead of Jefferson, who had
insisted that the project was unconstitutional,<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> Madison,
in the first Congress, had opposed the bill to
incorporate the first Bank of the United States. Congress
had no power, he said, to create corporations.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
After twelve years of able management, and in spite
of the good it had accomplished, Jefferson still considered
it, potentially, a monster that might overthrow
the Republic. "This institution," he wrote in
the third year of his Presidency, "is one of the most
deadly hostility existing, against the principles &amp;
form of our Constitution.... An institution like this,
penetrating by it's branches every part of the Union,
acting by command &amp; in phalanx, may, in a critical
moment, upset the government.... What an obstruction
could not this bank of the U.S., with all it's
branch banks, be in time of war?"<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>The fact that most of the stock of the Bank had
been bought up by Englishmen added to the unpopularity
of the institution.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> Another source of hostility
was the jealousy of State banks, much of the
complaint about "unconstitutionality" and "foreign
ownership" coming from the agents and friends
of these local concerns. The State banks wished for
themselves the profits made by the National Bank
and its branches, and they chafed under the wise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
regulation of their note issues, which the existence
of the National system compelled.</p>

<p>For several years these State banks had been
growing in number and activity.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> When, in 1808, the
directors of the Bank of the United States asked for
a renewal of its charter, which would expire in 1811,
and when the same request was made of Congress in
1809, opposition poured into the Capital from every
section of the country. The great Bank was a British
institution, it was said; its profits were too great;
it was a creature of Federalism, brought forth in
violation of the Constitution. Its directors, officers,
and American stockholders were Federalists; and
this fact was the next most powerful motive for the
overthrow of the first Bank of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>Petitions to Congress denounced it and demanded
its extinction. One from Pittsburgh declared "that
your memorialists are 'the People of the United
States,'" and asserted that the Bank "held in bondage
thousands of our citizens," kept the Government
"in duress," and subsidized the press, thus "thronging"
the Capital with lobbyists who in general were
the "head-waters of corruption."<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> The Legislatures
of many States "instructed" their Senators and
"earnestly requested" their Representatives in
Congress to oppose a new charter for the expiring
National institution. Such resolutions came from
Pennsylvania, from Virginia, from Massachusetts.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>The State banks were the principal contrivers of all
this agitation.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> For instance, the Bank of Virginia,
organized in 1804, had acquired great power and,
but for the branch of the National concern at Richmond,
would have had almost the banking monopoly
of that State. Especially did the Virginia Bank
desire to become the depository of National funds<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>&mdash;a
thing that could not be accomplished so long as
the Bank of the United States was in existence.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> Dr.
John Brockenbrough, the relative, friend, and political
associate of Spencer Roane and Thomas Ritchie,
was the president of this State institution, which
was a most important part of the Republican machine
in Virginia. Considering the absolute control
held by this political organization over the Legislature,
it seems probable that the State bank secured
the resolution condemnatory of the Bank of the
United States.</p>

<p>Certainly the General Assembly would not have
taken any action not approved by Brockenbrough,
Roane, and Ritchie. Ritchie's <i>Enquirer</i> boasted that
it "was the first to denounce the renewal of the bank
charter."<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> In the Senate, William H. Crawford
boldly charged that the instructions of the State Legislatures
were "induced by motives of avarice";<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>
and Senator Giles was plainly embarrassed in his
attempt to deny the indictment.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Nearly all the newspapers were controlled by the
State banks;<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> they, of course, denounced the National
Bank in the familiar terms of democratic controversy
and assailed the character of every public
man who spoke in behalf of so vile and dangerous an
institution.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> It was also an ideal object of assault for
local politicians who bombarded the Bank with their
usual vituperation. All this moved Senator Crawford,
in his great speech for the rechartering of the
Bank, to a scathing arraignment of such methods.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>In spite of conclusive arguments in favor of the
Bank of the United States on the merits of the question,
the bill to recharter that institution was de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>feated
in the House by a single vote,<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> and in the
Senate by the casting vote of the Vice-President, the
aged George Clinton.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> Thus, on the very threshold
of the War of 1812, the Government was deprived of
this all but indispensable fiscal agent; immense quantities
of specie, representing foreign bank holdings,
were withdrawn from the country; and the State
banks were given a free hand which they soon used
with unrestrained license.</p>

<p>These local institutions, which, from the moment
the failure of the rechartering of the National Bank
seemed probable, had rapidly increased in number,
now began to spring up everywhere.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> From the first
these concerns had issued bills for the loan of which
they charged interest. Thus banking was made
doubly profitable. Even those banks, whose note
issues were properly safeguarded, achieved immense
profits. Banking became a mania.</p>

<p>"The Banking Infatuation pervades all America,"
wrote John Adams in 1810. "Our whole system of
Banks is a violation of every honest Principle of
Banks.... A Bank that issues Paper at Interest is a
Pickpocket or a Robber. But the Delusion will have
its Course. You may as well reason with a Hurricane.
An Aristocracy is growing out of them, that
will be as fatal as The Feudal Barons, if unchecked
in Time.... Think of the Number, the Offices, Stations,
Wealth, Piety and Reputations of the Persons
in all the States, who have made Fortunes by these
Banks, and then you will see how deeply rooted the
evil is. The Number of Debtors who hope to pay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
their debts by this Paper united with the Creditors
who build Pallaces in our Cities, and Castles for
Country Seats, by issuing this Paper form too impregnable
a Phalanx to be attacked by any Thing
less disciplined than Roman Legions."<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>Such was the condition even before the expiration
of the charter of the first Bank. But, when the restraining
and regulating influence of that conservative
and ably managed institution was removed altogether,
local banking began a course that ended in
a mad carnival of roguery, to the ruin of legitimate
business and the impoverishment and bankruptcy
of hundreds of thousands of the general public.</p>

<p>The avarice of the State banks was immediately
inflamed by the war necessities of the National Government.
Desperate for money, the Treasury exchanged
six per cent United States bonds for the
notes of State banks.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> The Government thus lost
five million dollars from worthless bank bills.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> These
local institutions now became the sole depositories
of the Government funds which the National Bank
had formerly held.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Sources of gain of this kind were
only extra inducements to those who, by wit alone,
would gather quick wealth to set up more local banks.
But other advantages were quite enough to appeal
to the greedy, the dishonest, and the adventurous.</p>

<p>Liberty to pour out bills without effective restriction
as to the amount or security; to loan such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
"rags" to any who could be induced to borrow; to
collect these debts by foreclosure of mortgages or
threats of imprisonment of the debtors&mdash;these were
some of the seeds from which grew the noxious
financial weeds that began to suck the prosperity
of the country. When the first Bank of the United
States was organized there were only three State
banks in the country. By 1800, there were twenty-eight;
by 1811, they had more than trebled,<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> and
most of the eighty-eight State institutions in existence
when the first National Bank was destroyed
had been organized after it seemed probable that
it would not be granted a recharter.</p>

<p>So rapidly did they increase and so great were
their gains that, within little more than a year from
the demise of the first Bank of the United States,
John Adams records: "The Profits of our Banks to
the advantage of the few, at the loss of the many, are
such an enormous fraud and oppression as no other
Nation ever invented or endured. Who can compute
the amount of the sums taken out of the Pocketts of
the Simple and hoarded in the Purses of the cunning
in the course of every year?... If Rumour speaks the
Truth Boston has and will emulate Philadelphia in
her Proportion of Bankruptcies."<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>Yet Boston and Philadelphia banks were the
soundest and most carefully conducted of any in the
whole land. If Adams spoke extravagantly of the
methods and results of the best managed financial
institutions of the country, he did not exaggerate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
conditions elsewhere. From Connecticut to the
Mississippi River, from Lake Erie to New Orleans,
the craze for irresponsible banking spread like a contagious
fever. The people were as much affected
by the disease as were the speculators. The more
"money" they saw, the more "money" they wanted.
Bank notes fell in value; specie payments were suspended;
rates of exchange were in utter confusion
and constantly changing. From day to day no man
knew, with certainty, what the "currency" in his
pocket was worth. At Vincennes, Indiana, in 1818,
William Faux records: "I passed away my 20 dollar
note of the rotten bank of Harmony, Pennsylvania,
for five dollars only!"<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

<p>The continuance of the war, of course, made this
financial situation even worse for the Government
than for the people. It could not negotiate its loans;
the public dues were collected with difficulty, loss,
and delay; the Treasury was well-nigh bankrupt.
"The Department of State was so bare of money as
to be unable to pay even its stationery bill."<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> In
1814, when on the verge of financial collapse, the
Administration determined that another Bank of
the United States was absolutely necessary to the
conduct of the war.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> Scheme after scheme was
proposed, wrangled over, and defeated.</p>

<p>One plan for a bank<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> was beaten "after a day of
the most tumultuous proceedings I ever saw," testi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>fies
Webster.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> Another bill passed,<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> but was vetoed
by President Madison because it could not aid in
the rehabilitation of the public credit, nor "provide
a circulating medium during the war, nor ... furnish
loans, or anticipate public revenue."<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> When the war
was over, Madison timidly suggested to Congress the
advisability of establishing a National bank "that
the benefits of a uniform national currency should be
restored."<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Thus, on April 10, 1816, two years after
Congress took up the subject, a law finally was enacted
and approved providing for the chartering
and government of the second Bank of the United
States.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>Within four years, then, of the refusal of Congress
to recharter the sound and ably managed first Bank
of the United States, it was forced to authorize
another National institution, endowed with practically
the same powers possessed by the Bank which
Congress itself had so recently destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> But the
second establishment would have at least one advantage
over the first in the eyes of the predominant
political party&mdash;a majority of the officers
and directors of the Bank would be Republicans.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>During their four years of "financial liberty" the
number of State banks had multiplied. Those that
could be enumerated in 1816 were 246.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> In addition
to these, scores of others, most of them "pure swindles,"<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>
were pouring out their paper.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> Even if they
had been sound, not half of them were needed.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>
Nearly all of them extended their wild methods.
"The Banks have been going on, as tho' the day
of reckoning would never come," wrote Rufus King
of conditions in the spring of 1816.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>The people themselves encouraged these practices.
The end of the war released an immense quantity of
English goods which flooded the American market.
The people, believing that devastated Europe would
absorb all American products, and beholding a vision
of radiant prosperity, were eager to buy. A passion
for extravagance swept over America;<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> the
country was drained of specie by payments for
exports.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> Then came a frenzy of speculation. "The
people were wild; ... reason seemed turned topsy
turvey."<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<p>The multitude of local banks intensified both these
manias by every device that guile and avarice could
suggest. Every one wanted to get rich at the expense
of some one else by a mysterious process, the nature of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
which was not generally understood beyond the fact
that it involved some sort of trickery. Did any man's
wife and family want expensive clothing&mdash;the local
bank would loan him bills issued by itself, but only
on good security. Did any man wish to start some unfamiliar
and alluring enterprise by which to make a
fortune speedily&mdash;if he had a farm to mortgage, the
funds were his. Was a big new house desired? The
money was at hand&mdash;nothing was required to get it
but the pledge of property worth many times the
amount with which the bank "accommodated" him.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, the local banks urged such "investments,"
invited people with property to borrow, laid traps to
ensnare them. "What," asked Hezekiah Niles, "is
to be the end of such a business?&mdash;Mammoth fortunes
for the <i>wise</i>, wretched poverty for the <i>foolish</i>....
Lands, lots, houses&mdash;stock, farming utensils
and household furniture, under custody of the sheriff&mdash;SPECULATION
<span class="smcap">in a coach</span>, HONESTY <span class="smcap">in the
jail</span>."<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p>Many banks sent agents among the people to
hawk their bills. These were perfectly good, the harpies
would assure their victims, but they could now
be had at a heavy discount; to buy them was to make
a large profit. So the farmer, the merchant, even the
laborer who had acquired a dwelling of his own, were
induced to mortgage their property or sell it outright
in exchange for bank paper that often proved
to be worthless.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>Frequently these local banks ensnared prosperous
farmers by the use of "cappers." Niles prints con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>spicuously
as "A True Story"<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> the account of a
certain farmer who owned two thousand acres, well
improved and with a commodious residence and
substantial farm buildings upon it. Through his land
ran a stream affording good water power. He was
out of debt, prosperous, and contented. One day he
went to a town not many miles from his plantation.
There four pleasant-mannered, well-dressed men
made his acquaintance and asked him to dinner,
where a few directors of the local bank were present.
The conversation was brought around to the profits
to be made in the milling business. The farmer was
induced to borrow a large sum from the local bank
and build a mill, mortgaging his farm to secure
the loan. The mill was built, but seldom used because
there was no work for it to do; and, in the
end, the two thousand acres, dwelling, buildings,
mill, and all, became the property of the bank directors.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>This incident is illustrative of numerous similar
cases throughout the country, especially in the
West and South. Niles thus describes banking
methods in general: "At first they throw out money
profusely, to all that they believe are <i>ultimately</i>
able to return it; nay, they wind round some like serpents
to tempt them to borrow&mdash;... they then affect
to draw in their notes, ... money becomes scarce,
and notes of hand are <i>shaved</i> by them to meet bank
engagements; it gets worse&mdash;the <i>consummation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
originally</i> designed draws nigh, and farm after farm,
lot after lot, house after house, are sacrificed."<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p>So terrifying became the evil that the Legislature
of New York, although one of the worst offenders in
the granting of bank charters, was driven to appoint
a committee of investigation. It reported nothing
more than every honest observer had noted. Money
could not be transmitted from place to place, the
committee said, because local banks had "engrossed
the whole circulation in their neighborhood," while
their notes abroad had depreciated. The operations
of the bankers "immediately within their vicinity"
were ruinous: "Designing, unprincipled speculator[s] ... impose
on the credulity of the honest, industrious,
unsuspecting ... by their specious flattery and misrepresentation,
obtaining from them borrowed notes
and endorsements, until the ruin is consummated,
and their farms are sold by the sheriff."<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

<p>Some banks committed astonishing frauds, "such
as placing a partial fund in a distant bank to redeem
their paper" and then "issuing an emission of notes
signed with ink of a different shade, at the same time
giving secret orders to said bank not to pay the notes
thus signed." Bank paper, called "<i>facility notes</i>,"
was issued, but "payable in neither money, country
produce, or any thing else that has body or shape."
Bank directors even terrorized merchants who did
not submit to their practices. In one typical case all
persons were denied discounts who traded at a cer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>tain
store, the owner of which had asked for bank
bills that would be accepted in New York City, where
they had to be remitted&mdash;this, too, when the offending
merchant kept his account at the bank.</p>

<p>The committee describes, as illustrative of banking
chicanery, the instance of "an aged farmer,"
owner of a valuable farm, who, "wishing to raise the
sum of one thousand dollars, to assist his children,
was told by a director, he could get it out of the
bank ... and that he would endorse his note for
him." Thus the loan was made; but, when the note
expired, the director refused to obtain a renewal except
upon the payment of one hundred dollars in
addition to the discount. At the next renewal the
same condition was exacted and also "a judgment
... in favor of said director, and the result was,
his farm was soon after sold without his knowledge
by the sheriff, and purchased by the said director
for less than the judgment."<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>Before the second Bank of the United States
opened its doors for business, the local banks began
to gather the first fruits of their labors. By the end of
1816 suits upon promissory notes, bonds, and mortgages,
given by borrowers, were begun. Three fourths
of all judgments rendered in the spring of 1818 by the
Supreme Court of the State of New York alone were
"in favor of banks, against real property."<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> Suits
and judgments of this kind grew ever more frequent.</p>

<p>In such fashion was the country hastened toward
the period of bankruptcy. Yet the people in general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
still continued to demand more "money." The worse
the curse, the greater the floods of it called for by the
body of the public. "Like a dropsical man calling
out for water, water, our deluded citizens are clamoring
for more banks.... We are now taught to believe
that legerdemain tricks upon paper can produce as
solid wealth as hard labor in the earth," wrote Jefferson
when the financial madness was becoming too
apparent to all thoughtful men.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>Practically no restrictions were placed upon these
financial freebooters,<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> while such flimsy regulations
as their charters provided were disregarded at will.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
There was practically no publicity as to the management
and condition of even the best of these
banks;<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> most of them denied the right of any authority
to inquire into their affairs and scorned to furnish
information as to their assets or methods.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> For years
the Legislatures of many States were controlled by
these institutions; bank charters were secured by the
worst methods of legislative manipulation; lobbyists
thronged the State Capitols when the General
Assemblies were in session; few, if any, lawmaking
bodies of the States were without officers, directors,
or agents of local banks among their membership.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus bank charters were granted by wholesale and
they were often little better than permits to plunder
the public. During the session of the Virginia
Legislature of 1816-17, twenty-two applications for
bank charters were made.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> At nearly the same time
twenty-one banks were chartered in the newly admitted
and thinly peopled State of Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> The following
year forty-three new banks were authorized
in Kentucky.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> In December, 1818, James Flint
found in Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee a "vast
host of fabricators, and venders of base money."<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
All sorts of "companies" went into the banking business.
Bridge companies, turnpike companies, manufacturing
companies, mercantile companies, were authorized
to issue their bills, and this flood of paper
became the "money" of the people; even towns and
villages emitted "currency" in the form of municipal
notes. The City of Richmond, Virginia, in 1815, issued
"small paper bills for change, to the amount of
$29,948."<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> Often bills were put in circulation of
denominations as low as six and one fourth cents.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Rapidly the property of the people became encumbered
to secure their indebtedness to the banks.</p>

<p>A careful and accurate Scotch traveler thus describes
their methods: "By lending, and otherwise
emitting their engravings, they have contrived to
mortgage and buy much of the property of their
neighbours, and to appropriate to themselves the
labour of less moneyed citizens.... Bankers gave in
exchange for their paper, that of <i>other banks, equally
good with their own</i>.... The holder of the paper may
comply in the barter, or keep the notes ...; but he
finds it too late to be delivered from the snare. The
people committed the lapsus, when they accepted
of the gew-gaws clean from the press.... The deluded
multitude have been basely duped."<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> Yet,
says Flint, "every one is afraid of bursting the
bubble."<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p>As settlers penetrated the Ohio and Indiana forests
and spread over the Illinois prairies, the banks
went with them and "levied their contributions on
the first stroke of the axe."<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> Kentucky was comparatively
well settled and furnished many emigrants
to the newer regions north of the Ohio River. Rough

were poorly educated.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> They were, however, hospitable,
generous, and brave; but most of them preferred
to speculate rather than to work.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> Illness was

<p>In short, the settlers reproduced most of the features
of the same movement in the preceding generation.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>
There was the same squalor, suspicion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
credulity, and the same combativeness,<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> the same
assertion of superiority over every other people on
earth,<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> the same impatience of control, particularly
from a source so remote as the National Government.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>
"The people speak and seem as if they were
without a government, and name it only as a bugbear,"
wrote William Faux.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the inhabitants of one section knew lit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>tle
or nothing of what those in another were doing.
"We are as ignorant of the temper prevailing in the
Eastern States as the people of New Holland can
be," testifies John Randolph in 1812.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> Even a generation
after Randolph made this statement, Frederick
Marryat records that "the United States ... comprehend
an immense extent of territory, with a population
running from a state of refinement down to one
of positive barbarism.... The inhabitants of the cities
... know as little of what is passing in Arkansas and
Alabama as a cockney does of the manners and customs
of ... the Isle of Man."<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> Communities were still
almost as segregated as were those of a half-century
earlier.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> Marryat observes, a few years later, that
"to write upon America <i>as a nation</i> would be absurd,
for nation ... it is not."<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> Again, he notes in his
journal that "the mass of the citizens of the United
States have ... a very great dislike to all law except ...
the decision of the majority."<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p>These qualities furnished rich soil for cultivation
by demagogues, and small was the husbandry required
to produce a sturdy and bellicose sentiment
of Localism. Although the bills of the Bank of the
United States were sought for,<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> the hostility to that
National institution was increased rather than diminished
by the superiority of its notes over those
of the local money mills. No town was too small
for a bank. The fact that specie payments were
not exacted "indicated every village in the United<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
States, where there was a 'church, a tavern and a
blacksmith's shop,' as a suitable site for a <i>bank</i>, and
justified any persons in establishing one who could
raise enough to pay the <i>paper maker</i> and <i>engraver</i>."<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>Not only did these chartered manufactories of
currency multiply, but private banks sprang up and
did business without any restraint whatever. Niles
was entirely within the truth when he declared that
nothing more was necessary to start a banking business
than plates, presses, and paper.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Often the notes
of the banks, private or incorporated, circulated only
in the region where they were issued.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> In 1818 the
"currency" of the local banks of Cincinnati was
"mere waste paper ... out of the city."<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> The people
had to take this local "money" or go without any
medium of exchange. When the notes of distant
banks were to be had, the people did not know the
value of them. "Notes current in one part, are
either refused, or taken at a large discount, in another,"
wrote Flint in 1818.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>In the cities firms dealing with bank bills printed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
lists of them with the market values, which changed
from day to day.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> Sometimes the county courts fixed
rates of exchange; for instance, the County Court
of Norfolk County, Virginia, in March, 1816, decreed
that the notes of the Bank of Virginia and the
Bank of South Carolina were worth their face value,
while the bills of Baltimore and Philadelphia and the
District of Columbia were below par.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> Merchants
had to keep lists on which was estimated the value of
bank bills and to take chances on the constant fluctuations
of them.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> "Of upwards of a hundred banks
that lately figured in Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, and
Tennessee, the money of two is now only received in
the land-office, in payment for public lands," testifies
Flint, writing from Jeffersonville, Indiana, in March,
1820. "Discount," he adds, "varies from thirty to
one hundred per cent."<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> By September, 1818, two
thirds of the bank bills sent to Niles in payment for
the <i>Register</i> could not "be passed for money."<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p>"Chains" of banks were formed by which one
member of the conspiracy would redeem its notes
only by paying out the bills of another. Thus, if a
man presented at the counter of a certain bank the
bills issued by it, he was given in exchange those of
another bank; when these were taken to this second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
institution, they were exchanged for the bills of a
third bank, which redeemed them with notes of the
first.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> For instance, Bigelow's bank at Jeffersonville,
Indiana, redeemed its notes with those of Piatt's
bank at Cincinnati, Ohio; this, in turn, paid its
bills with those of a Vincennes sawmill and the sawmill
exchanged its paper for that of Bigelow's bank.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>The redemption of their bills by the payment of
specie was refused even by the best State banks, and
this when the law positively required it. Niles estimated
in April, 1818, that, although many banks
were sound and honestly conducted, there were not
"half a dozen banks in the United States that are
able to pay their debts <i>as they are payable</i>."<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>All this John Marshall saw and experienced. In
1815, George Fisher<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> presented to the Bank of
Virginia ten of its one-hundred-dollar notes for redemption,
which was refused. After several months'
delay, during which the bank officials ignored a
summons to appear in court, a distringas<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> was
secured. The President of the bank, Dr. Brockenbrough,
resisted service of the writ, and the "Sheriff
then called upon the by-standers, as a <i>posse comitatus</i>,"
to assist him. Among these was the Chief
Justice of the United States. Fisher had hard work
in finding a lawyer to take his case; for months no
member of the bar would act as his attorney.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> For
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>in Virginia as elsewhere&mdash;even less than in many
States&mdash;the local banks were the most lucrative
clients and the strongest political influence; and they
controlled the lawyers as well as the press.</p>

<p>In June, 1818, for instance, a business man in
Pennsylvania had accumulated several hundred dollars
in bills of a local bank which refused to redeem
them in specie or better bills. Three justices of the
peace declined to entertain suit against the bank and
no notary public would protest the bills. In Maryland,
at the same time, a man succeeded in bringing
an action against a bank for the redemption of some
of its bills; but the cashier, while admitting his own
signature on the notes, swore that he could not identify
that of the bank's president, who had absented
himself.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>Counterfeiting was widely practiced and, for a
time, almost unpunished; a favorite device was the
raising of notes, usually from five to fifty dollars.
Bills were put in circulation purporting to have been
issued by distant banks that did not exist, and never
had existed. In a single week of June, 1818, the
country newspapers contained accounts of twenty-eight
cases of these and similar criminal operations.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>
Sometimes a forger or counterfeiter was caught; at
Plattsburg, New York, one of these had twenty different
kinds of fraudulent notes, "well executed."<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
In August, 1818, Niles estimates that "the notes of
at least <span class="smcap">one hundred</span> banks in the United States are
counterfeited."<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> By the end of the year an organized
gang of counterfeiters, forgers, and distributors of
their products covered the whole country.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Counterfeits
of the Marine Bank of Baltimore alone were

Scarcely an issue of any newspaper appeared without
notices of these depredations;<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> one half of the remittances
sent Niles from the West were counterfeit.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>Into this chaos of speculation, fraud, and financial
fiction came the second Bank of the United
States. The management of it, at the beginning, was
adventurous, erratic, corrupt; its officers and directors
countenanced the most shameful manipulation
of the Bank's stock; some of them participated
in the incredible jobbery.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> Nothing of this, however,
was known to the country at large for many
months,<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> nor did the knowledge of it, when revealed,
afford the occasion for the popular wrath that soon
came to be directed against the National Bank. This
public hostility, indeed, was largely produced by
measures which the Bank took to retrieve the early
business blunders of its managers.</p>

<p>These blunders were appalling. As soon as it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
opened in 1817, the Bank began to do business on the
inflated scale which the State banks had established;
by over-issue of its notes it increased the inflation,
already blown to the bursting point. Except in New
England, where its loans were moderate and well
secured, it accommodated borrowers lavishly. The
branches were not required to limit their business to
a fixed capital; in many cases, the branch officers and
directors, incompetent and swayed by local interest
and feeling,<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> issued notes as recklessly as did some
of the State banks. In the West particularly, and
also in the South, the loans made were enormous.
The borrowers had no expectation of paying them
when due, but of renewing them from time to time,
as had been the practice under State banking.</p>

<p>The National branches in these regions showed a
faint gleam of prudence by refusing to accept bills
of notoriously unsound local banks. This undemocratic
partiality, although timidly exercised, aroused
to activity the never-slumbering hostility of these
local concerns. In the course of business, however,
bills of most State banks accumulated to an immense
amount in the vaults of the branches of the Bank
of the United States. When, in spite of the disposition
of the branch officers to extend unending and
unlimited indulgence to the State banks and to borrowers
generally, the branches finally were compelled
by the parent Bank to demand payment of loans and
redemption of bills of local banks held by it; and
when, in consequence, the State banks were forced
to collect debts due them, the catastrophe, so long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
preparing, fell upon sections where the vices of State
banking had been practiced most flagrantly.</p>

<p>Suits upon promissory notes, bonds and mortgages,
already frequent, now became incessant; sheriffs
were never idle. In the autumn of 1818, in a
single small county<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> of Delaware, one hundred and
fifty such actions were brought by the banks. In
addition to this, records the financial chronicler of
the period, "their vaults are loaded with bonds,
mortgages and other securities, held <i>in terrorem</i> over
the heads of several hundreds more."<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> At Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania, one bank brought more than
one hundred suits during May, 1818;<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> a few months
later a single issue of one country newspaper in Pennsylvania
contained advertisements of eighteen farms
and mills at sheriff's sale; a village newspaper in New
York advertised sixty-three farms and lots to be sold
under the sheriff's hammer.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> "Currency" decreased
in quantity; unemployment was amazing; scores of
thousands of men begged for work; throngs of the
idle camped near cities and subsisted on charity.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>All this the people laid at the doors of the National
Bank, while the State banks,<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> of course, encouraged
the popular animosity. Another order of
the National concern increased the anger of the
people and of the State banks against it. For more
than a year the parent institution and its branches
had redeemed all notes issued by them wherever presented.
Since the notes from the West and South<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
flowed to the North and East<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> in payment for the
manufactures and merchandise of these sections, this
universal redemption became impossible. So, on
August 28, 1818, the branches were directed to
refuse all notes except their own.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p>Thus the Bank, "like an <i>abandoned</i> mother, ...
<span class="smcap">bastardized</span> its offspring,"<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> said the enemies of the
National Bank, among them all State banks and
most of the people. The enforcement of redemption
of State bank bills, the reduction of the volume of
"currency," were the real causes of the fury with
which the Bank of the United States and its branches
was now assailed. That institution was the monster,
said local orators and editors; its branches were the
tentacles of the Octopus, heads of the Hydra.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> "The
'branches' are execrated on all hands," wrote an
Ohio man. "We <i>feel</i> that to the policy pursued by
them, we are indebted for all the evils we experience
for want of a circulating medium."<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p>The popular cry was for relief. More money, not
less, was needed, it was said; and more banks that
could and would loan funds with which to pay debts.
If the creditor would not accept the currency thus
procured, let laws be passed that would compel him
to do so, or prevent him from collecting what his contract
called for. Thus, with such demands upon
their lips, and in the midst of a storm of lawsuits, the
people entered at last that inevitable period of bank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>ruptcy
to which for years they had been drawing
nearer and for which they were themselves largely
responsible.</p>

<p>Bankruptcy laws had already been enacted by some
States; and if these acts had not been drawn for the
benefit of speculators in anticipation of the possible
evil day, the "insolvency" statutes certainly had
been administered for the protection of rich and dishonest
men who wished to escape their liabilities,
and yet to preserve their assets. In New York<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> the
debtor was enabled to discharge all accounts by
turning over such property as he had; if he owed ten
thousand dollars, and possessed but fifty dollars, his
debt was cancelled by the surrender of that sum.
For the honest and prudent man the law was just,
since no great discrepancy usually existed between
his reported assets and his liabilities. But lax administration
of it afforded to the dishonest adventurer
a shield from the righteous consequences of his
wrongdoing.</p>

<p>The "bankruptcies" of knavish men were common
operations. One merchant in an Eastern city
"failed," but contrived to go on living in a house for
which he "was offered $200,000 in real money."<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>
Another in Philadelphia became "insolvent," yet
had $7000 worth of wine in his cellar at the very
time he was going through "bankruptcy."<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> A merchant
tailor in the little town of York, Pennsylvania,
resorted to bankruptcy to clear himself of eighty-four
thousand dollars of debt.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>In their speculations adventurous men counted on
the aid of these legislative acts for the relief of
debtors. "Never ... have any ... laws been more productive
of crime than the insolvent laws of Maryland,"
testifies Niles.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> One issue of the <i>Federal
Gazette</i> contained six columns of bankruptcy notices,
and these were only about "one-third of the persons"
then "'going through our mill.'" Several
"bankrupts" had been millionaires, and continued
to "<i>live in splendid affluence</i>, ... their wives and
children, or some kind relative, having been made
rich through their swindlings of the people."<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>
Many "insolvents" were bankers; and this led Niles
to propose that the following law be adopted:</p>

<p>"'Whereas certain persons ... <i>unknown</i>, have petitioned
for the establishment of a bank at &mdash;&mdash;:</p>

<p>"'Be it enacted, that ... these persons, ... shall
have liberty to become <span class="smcap">bankrupts</span>, and may legally
swindle as much as they can.'"<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>In a Senate debate in March, 1820, for a proposed
new National Bankruptcy Act,<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> Senator Harrison
Gray Otis of Massachusetts moderately stated the
results of the State insolvency laws. "Merchants
and traders ... are harassed and perplexed by twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
different systems of municipal laws, often repugnant
to each other and themselves; always defective; seldom
executed in good faith; prolific in endless frauds,
perjuries, and evasions; and never productive of ...
any sort of justice, to the creditor. Nothing could be
... comparable to their pernicious effects upon the
public morals."<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> Senator Prentiss Mellen, of the
same State, described the operation of the bankruptcy
mill thus: "We frequently witness transactions,
poisoned throughout with fraud ... in which <i>all</i>
creditors are deceived and defrauded.... The man
<i>pretends</i> to be a bankrupt; and having converted
a large portion of his property into money ... he ...
closes his doors; ... goes through the form of offering
to give up all his property, (though secretly retaining
thousands,) on condition of receiving a discharge
from his creditors.... In a few months, or
perhaps weeks, he recommences business, and finds
himself ... with a handsome property at command."<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

<p>Senator James Burrill, Jr., of Rhode Island was
equally specific and convincing. He pictured the
career of a dishonest merchant, who transfers property
to relatives, secures a discharge from the State

<p>It was soon to be the good fortune of John Marshall
to declare such State legislation null and void
because in violation of the National Constitution.
Never did common honesty, good faith, and fair
dealing need such a stabilizing power as at the moment
Marshall furnished to the American people.
In most parts of the country even insolvency laws
did not satisfy debtors; they were trying to avoid the
results of their own acts by securing the enactment
of local statutes that repealed the natural laws of
human intercourse&mdash;of statutes that expressed the
momentary wish of the uncomfortable, if honest,
multitude, but that represented no less the devices
of the clever and unscrupulous. Fortunate, indeed,
was it for the United States, at this critical time in
its development, that one department of the Government
could not be swayed by the passion of the hour,
and thrice happy that the head of that department
was John Marshall.</p>

<p>The impression made directly on Marshall by
what took place under his very eyes in Virginia was
strengthened by events that occurred in Kentucky.
All his brothers and sisters, except two, besides
numerous cousins and relatives by marriage, lived
there. Thus he was advised in an intimate and personal
way of what went forward in that State.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>The indebtedness of Kentucky State banks, and of
individual borrowers to the branches of the National
Bank located in that Commonwealth, amounted
to more than two and one half millions of dollars.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>
"This is the <i>trifling</i> sum which the people of Kentucky
are called upon to pay in <i>specie</i>!"<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> exclaimed
a Kentucky paper. The people of that State owed
the local banks about $7,000,000 more, while the
total indebtedness to all financial institutions within
Kentucky was not far from $10,000,000.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> The sacrifice
of property for the satisfaction of mortgages
grew ever more distressing. At Lexington, a house
and lot, for which the owner had refused $15,000,
brought but $1300 at sheriff's sale; another costing
$10,000 sold under the hammer for $1500.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> Even
slaves could be sold only at a small fraction of their
ordinary market price.</p>

<p>It was the same in other States. Within Marshall's
personal observation in Virginia the people were
forced to eat the fruits of their folly. "Lands in this
State cannot now be sold for a year's rent," wrote
Jefferson.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> A farm near Easton, Pennsylvania,
worth $12,500, mortgaged to secure a debt of $2500,
was taken by the lender on foreclosure for the
amount of the loan. A druggist's stock of the retail
value of $10,000 was seized for rent by the landlord
and sold for $400.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> In Virginia a little later a farm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
of three hundred acres with improvements worth,
at the lowest estimate, $1500, sold for $300; two
wagon horses costing $200 were sacrificed for $40.</p>

<p>Mines were shut down, shops closed, taxes unpaid.
"The debtor ... gives up his land, and, ruined
and undone, seeks a home for himself and his family
in the western wilderness."<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> John Quincy Adams
records in his diary: "Staple productions ... are
falling to ... less than half the prices which they
have lately borne, the merchants are crumbling to
ruin, the manufactures perishing, agriculture stagnating,
and distress universal in every part of the
country."<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></p>

<p>During the summer and autumn of 1818, the
popular demand for legislation that would suspend
contracts, postpone the payment of debts, and stay
the judgment of courts, became strident and peremptory.
"Our greatest real evil is the question
between debtor and creditor, into which the banks
have plunged us deeper than would have been possible
without them," testifies Adams. "The bank
debtors are everywhere so numerous and powerful
that they control the newspapers throughout the
Union, and give the discussion a turn extremely
erroneous, and prostrate every principle of political
economy."<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p>This was especially true of Kentucky. Throughout
the State great assemblages were harangued
by oratorical "friends of the people." "The reign
of political quackery was in its glory."<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> Why the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
scarcity of money when that commodity was most
needed? Why the lawsuits for the collection of
debts, the enforcement of bonds, the foreclosure
of mortgages, instead of the renewal of loans, to
which debtors had been accustomed? Financial manipulation
had done it all. The money power was
responsible for the misery of the people. Let that
author and contriver of human suffering be suppressed.</p>

<p>What could be easier or more just than to enact
legislation that would lift the burden of debt that
was crushing the people? The State banks would
not resist&mdash;were they not under the control of the
people's Legislature? But they were also at the
mercy of that remorseless creature of the National
Government, the Bank of the United States. That
malign Thing was the real cause of all the trouble.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>
Let the law by which Congress had given illegitimate
life to that destroyer of the people's well-being
be repealed. If that could not be done because
so many of the National Legislature were corruptly
interested in the Bank, the States had a sure weapon
with which to destroy it&mdash;or at least to drive it out
of business in every member of the Union.</p>

<p>That weapon was taxation. Let each Legislature,
by special taxes, strangle the branches of the National
Bank operating in the States. So came a
popular determination to exterminate, by State
action, the second Bank of the United States. Na<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>tional
power should be brought to its knees by local
authority! National agencies should be made helpless
and be dispatched by State prohibition and State
taxation! The arm of the National Government
should be paralyzed by the blows showered on it
when thrusting itself into the affairs of "sovereign"
States! Already this process was well under way.</p>

<p>The first Constitution of Indiana, adopted soon
after Congress had authorized the second Bank of
the United States, prohibited any bank chartered
outside the State from doing business within its
borders.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> During the very month that the National
Bank opened its doors in 1817, the Legislature of
Maryland passed an act taxing the Baltimore branch
$15,000 annually. Seven months afterward the
Legislature of Tennessee enacted a law that any
bank not chartered under its authority should pay
$50,000 each year for the privilege of banking in
that State. A month later Georgia placed a special
tax on branches of the Bank of the United States.</p>

<p>The Constitution of Illinois, adopted in August,
1818, forbade the establishment of any but State
banks. In December of that year North Carolina
taxed the branch of the National Bank in that State
$5000 per annum. A few weeks later Kentucky laid
an annual tax of $60,000 on each of the two branches
of the Bank of the United States located at Lexington
and Frankfort. Three weeks before John
Marshall delivered his opinion in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i>
Maryland, Ohio enacted a statute placing a yearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
tax of $50,000 on each of the two National Bank
branches then doing business in that State.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<p>Thus the extinction of the second Bank of the
United States by State legislation appeared to be
inevitable. The past management of it had well
deserved this fate; but earnest efforts were now in
operation to recover it from former blunders and to
retrieve its fortunes. The period of corruption was
over, and a new, able, and honest management was
about to take charge. If, however, the States could
destroy this National fiscal agency, it mattered not
how well it might thereafter be conducted, for nothing
could be more certain than that the local influence
of State banks always would be great enough
to induce State Legislatures to lay impossible burdens
on the National Bank.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the situation that produced those
opinions of Marshall on insolvency, on contract,
and on a National bank, delivered during February
and March of 1819; such the National conditions
which confronted him during the preceding summer
and autumn. He could do nothing to ameliorate
these conditions, nothing to relieve the universal
unhappiness, nothing to appease the popular discontent.
But he could establish great National principles,
which would give steadiness to American
business, vitality to the National Government; and
which would encourage the people to practice honesty,
prudence, and thrift. And just this John Marshall
did. When considering the enduring work he
performed at this time, we must have in our thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
the circumstances that made that work vitally necessary.</p>

<p>One of the earliest cases decided by the Supreme
Court in 1819 involved the Bankrupt Law of New
York. On November 25, 1817, Josiah Sturges<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> of
Massachusetts sued Richard Crowninshield of New
York in the United States Circuit Court for the
District of Massachusetts to recover upon two promissory
notes for the sum of $771.86 each, executed
March 22, 1811, just twelve days before the
passage, April 3, 1811, of the New York statute
for the relief of insolvent debtors. The defendant
pleaded his discharge under that act. The judges
were divided in opinion on the questions whether
a State can pass a bankrupt act, whether the New
York law was a bankrupt act, and whether it impaired
the obligations of a contract. These questions
were, accordingly, certified to the Supreme
Court.</p>

<p>The case was there argued long and exhaustively
by David Daggett and Joseph Hopkinson for Sturges
and by David B. Ogden and William Hunter for
Crowninshield. In weight of reasoning and full citation
of authority, the discussion was inferior only
to those contests before the Supreme Bench which
have found a place in history.</p>

<p>On February 17, 1819, Marshall delivered the
unanimous opinion of the court.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> Do the words of
the Constitution, "Congress shall have power ...
to establish ... uniform laws on the subject of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
bankruptcies throughout the United States" take
from the States the right to pass such laws?</p>

<p>Before the adoption of the Constitution, begins
Marshall, the States "united for some purposes,
but, in most respects, sovereign," could "exercise
almost every legislative power." The powers of the
States under the Constitution were not defined in
that instrument. "These powers proceed, not from
the people of America, but from the people of the
several states; and remain, after the adoption of
the constitution, what they were before, except so
far as they may be abridged" by the Nation's fundamental
law.</p>

<p>While the "mere grant of a power to Congress"
does not necessarily mean that the States are forbidden
to exercise the same power, such concurrent
power does not extend to "every possible case" not
expressly prohibited by the Constitution. "The
confusion resulting from such a practice would be
endless." As a general principle, declares the Chief
Justice, "whenever the terms in which a power is
granted to Congress, or the nature of the power,
required that it should be exercised exclusively by
Congress, the subject is as completely taken from
the state legislatures as if they had been expressly
forbidden to act on it."<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></p>

<span class="caption"><i>John Marshall<br />

<small>From the bust in the Court Room of the United States Supreme Court</small></i></span>
</div>
<p>Does this general principle apply to bankrupt
laws? Assuredly it does. Congress is empowered to
"establish uniform laws on the subject throughout
the United States." Uniform National legislation is
"incompatible with state legislation" on the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
subject. Marshall draws a distinction between bankrupt
and insolvency laws, although "the line of
partition between them is not so distinctly marked"
that it can be said, "with positive precision, what
belongs exclusively to the one, and not to the other
class of laws."<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

<p>He enters upon an examination of the nature of
insolvent laws which States may enact, and bankrupt
laws which Congress may enact; and finds that
"there is such a connection between them as to render
it difficult to say how far they may be blended
together.... A bankrupt law may contain those
regulations which are generally found in insolvent
laws"; while "an insolvent law may contain those
which are common to a bankrupt law." It is "obvious,"
then, that it would be a hardship to "deny
to the state legislatures the power of acting on this
subject, in consequence of the grant to Congress."
The true rule&mdash;"certainly a convenient one"&mdash;is
to "consider the power of the states as existing over
such cases as the laws of the Union may not reach."<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>But, whether this common-sense construction is
adopted or not, it is undeniable that Congress may
exercise a power granted to it or decline to exercise
it. So, if Congress thinks that uniform bankrupt
laws "ought not to be established" throughout the
country, surely the State Legislatures ought not,
on that account, to be prevented from passing
bankrupt acts. The idea of Marshall, the statesman,
was that it was better to have bankrupt laws of some
kind than none at all. "It is not the mere existence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
of the power [in Congress], but its exercise, which is
incompatible with the exercise of the same power by
the states. It is not the right to establish these uniform
laws, but their actual establishment, which is
inconsistent with the partial acts of the states."<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></p>

<p>Even should Congress pass a bankrupt law, that
action does not extinguish, but only suspends, the
power of the State to legislate on the same subject.
When Congress repeals a National bankrupt law it
merely "removes a disability" of the State created
by the enactment of the National statute, and lasting
only so long as that statute is in force. In short,
"until the power to pass uniform laws on the subject
of bankruptcies be exercised by Congress, the states
are not forbidden to pass a bankrupt law, provided it
contain no principle which violates the 10th section
of the first article of the constitution of the United
States."<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>Having toilsomely reached this conclusion, Marshall
comes to what he calls "the great question on
which the cause must depend": Does the New York
Bankrupt Law "impair the obligation of contracts"?<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<p>What is the effect of that law? It "liberates the
person of the debtor, and discharges him from all
liability for any debt previously contracted, on his
surrendering his property in the manner it prescribes."
Here Marshall enters upon that series of
expositions of the contract clause of the Constitu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>tion
which, next to the Nationalism of his opinions,
is, perhaps, the most conspicuous feature of his
philosophy of government and human intercourse.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>
"What is the obligation of a contract? and what will
impair it?"<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<p>It would be hard to find words "more intelligible,
or less liable to misconstruction, than those which
are to be explained." With a tinge of patient impatience,
the Chief Justice proceeds to define the
words "contract," "impair," and "obligation," much
as a weary school teacher might teach the simplest
lesson to a particularly dull pupil.</p>

<p>"A contract is an agreement in which a party
undertakes to do, or not to do, a particular thing.
The law binds him to perform his undertaking, and
this is, of course, the obligation of his contract. In
the case at bar, the defendant has given his promissory
note to pay the plaintiff a sum of money on
or before a certain day. The contract binds him to
pay that sum on that day; and this is its obligation.
Any law which releases a part of this obligation,
must, in the literal sense of the word, impair it.
Much more must a law impair it which makes it
totally invalid, and entirely discharges it.</p>

<p>"The words of the constitution, then, are express,
and incapable of being misunderstood. They admit
of no variety of construction, and are acknowledged
to apply to that species of contract, an engagement
between man and man, for the payment of money,
which has been entered into by these parties."<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>What are the arguments that such law does not
violate the Constitution? One is that, since a contract
"can only bind a man to pay to the full extent
of his property, it is an implied condition that he
may be discharged on surrendering the whole of it."
This is simply not true, says Marshall. When a
contract is made, the parties to it have in mind,
not only existing property, but "future acquisitions.
Industry, talents and integrity, constitute a fund
which is as confidently trusted as property itself.
Future acquisitions are, therefore, liable for contracts;
and to release them from this liability impairs
their obligation."<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<p>Marshall brushes aside, almost brusquely, the
argument that the only reason for the adoption of
the contract clause by the Constitutional Convention
was the paper money evil; that the States
always had passed bankrupt and insolvent laws;
and that if the framers of the Constitution had
intended to deprive the States of this power, "insolvent
laws would have been mentioned in the
prohibition."</p>

<p>No power whatever, he repeats, is conferred on
the States by the Constitution. That instrument
found them "in possession" of practically all legislative
power and either prohibited "its future
exercise entirely," or restrained it "so far as national
policy may require."</p>

<p>While the Constitution permits States to pass
bankrupt laws "until that power shall be exercised
by Congress," the fundamental law positively for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>bids
the States to "introduce into such laws a
clause which discharges the obligations the bankrupt
has entered into. It is not admitted that,
without this principle, an act cannot be a bankrupt
law; and if it were, that admission would not change
the constitution, nor exempt such acts from its
prohibitions."<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>There was, said Marshall, nothing in the argument
that, if the framers of the Constitution had intended
to "prohibit the States from passing insolvent
laws," they would have plainly said so. "It was not
necessary, nor would it have been safe" for them to
have enumerated "particular subjects to which the
principle they intended to establish should apply."</p>

<p>On this subject, as on every other dealt with in
the Constitution, fundamental principles are set
out. What is the one involved in this case? It is
"the inviolability of contracts. This principle was
to be protected in whatsoever form it might be
assailed. To what purpose enumerate the particular
modes of violation which should be forbidden, when
it was intended to forbid all?... The plain and simple
declaration, that no state shall pass any law impairing
the obligation of contracts, includes insolvent
laws and all other laws, so far as they
infringe the principle the convention intended to
hold sacred, and no farther."<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<p>At this point Marshall displays the humanitarian
which, in his character, was inferior only to the
statesman. He was against imprisonment for debt,
one of the many brutal customs still practiced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
"The convention did not intend to prohibit the
passage of all insolvent laws," he avows. "To punish
honest insolvency by imprisonment for life, and
to make this a constitutional principle, would be an
excess of inhumanity which will not readily be imputed
to the illustrious patriots who framed our
constitution, nor to the people who adopted it....
Confinement of the debtor may be a punishment
for not performing his contract, or may be allowed
as a means of inducing him to perform it. But the
state may refuse to inflict this punishment, or may
withhold this means and leave the contract in full
force. Imprisonment is no part of the contract, and
simply to release the prisoner does not impair its
obligation."<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<p>Following his provoking custom of taking up a
point with which he had already dealt, Marshall
harks back to the subject of the reason for inserting
the contract clause into the Constitution. He restates
the argument against applying that provision
to State insolvent laws&mdash;that, from the beginning,
the Colonies and States had enacted such legislation;
that the history of the times shows that "the mind
of the convention was directed to other laws which
were fraudulent in their character, which enabled
the debtor to escape from his obligation, and yet
hold his property, not to this, which is beneficial in
its operation."</p>

<p>But, he continues, "the spirit of ... a constitution"
is not to be determined solely by a partial
view of the history of the times when it was adopted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>&mdash;"the
spirit is to be collected chiefly from its
words." And "it would be dangerous in the extreme
to infer from extrinsic circumstances, that a case
for which the words of an instrument expressly
provide, shall be exempted from its operation."
Where language is obscure, where words conflict,
"construction becomes necessary." But, when language
is clear, words harmonious, the plain meaning
of that language and of those words is not "to
be disregarded, because we believe the framers of
that instrument could not intend what they say."<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

<p>The practice of the Colonies, and of the States
before the Constitution was adopted, was a weak
argument at best. For example, the Colonies and
States had issued paper money, emitted bills of
credit, and done other things, all of which the Constitution
prohibits. "If the long exercise of the
power to emit bills of credit did not restrain the
convention from prohibiting its future exercise,
neither can it be said that the long exercise of the
power to impair the obligation of contracts, should
prevent a similar prohibition." The fact that insolvent
laws are not forbidden "by name" does not
exclude them from the operation of the contract
clause of the Constitution. It is "a principle which
is to be forbidden; and this principle is described in
as appropriate terms as our language affords."<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps paper money was the chief and impelling
reason for making the contract clause a part of the
National Constitution. But can the operation of
that clause be confined to paper money? "No court<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
can be justified in restricting such comprehensive
words to a particular mischief to which no allusion
is made." The words must be given "their full
and obvious meaning."<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> Doubtless the evils of
paper money directed the Convention to the subject
of contracts; but it did far more than to make paper
money impossible thereafter. "In the opinion of
the convention, much more remained to be done.
The same mischief might be effected by other means.
To restore public confidence completely, it was
necessary not only to prohibit the use of particular
means by which it might be effected, but to prohibit
the use of any means by which the same
mischief might be produced. The convention appears
to have intended to establish a great principle,
that contracts should be inviolable. The constitution
therefore declares, that no state shall pass 'any
law impairing the obligation of contracts.'"<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> From
all this it follows that the New York Bankruptcy
Act of 1812 is unconstitutional because it impaired
the obligations of a contract.</p>

<p>The opinion of the Chief Justice aroused great
excitement.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> It, of course, alarmed those who had
been using State insolvent laws to avoid payment
of their debts, while retaining much of their wealth.
It also was unwelcome to the great body of honest,
though imprudent, debtors who were struggling to
lighten their burdens by legislation. But the more
thoughtful, even among radicals, welcomed Marshall's
pronouncement. Niles approved it heartily.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>Gradually, surely, Marshall's simple doctrine
grew in favor throughout the whole country, and is
to-day a vital and enduring element of American
thought and character as well as of Constitutional
law.</p>

<p>As in Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck, the principle of the inviolability
of contracts was applied where a State
and individuals are parties, so the same principle
was now asserted in Sturges <i>vs.</i> Crowninshield as to
State laws impairing the obligation of contracts
between man and man. At the same session, in the
celebrated Dartmouth College case,<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> Marshall announced
that this principle also covers charters
granted by States. Thus did he develop the idea
of good faith and stability of engagement as a life-giving
principle of the American Constitution.</p>

These were in addition to the branches of the Bank of Kentucky and
of the Bank of the United States. Including them, the number of
chartered banks in that State was fifty-eight by the close of 1818.
Of the towns where new banks were established during that year,
Burksville had 106 inhabitants; Barboursville, 55; Hopkinsville, 131;
Greenville, 75; thirteen others had fewer than 500 inhabitants. The
"capital" of the banks in such places was never less than $100,000,

In southwestern Indiana, in 1818, Faux "saw nothing ... but miserable
log holes, and a mean ville of eight or ten huts or cabins, sadly neglected
farms, and indolent, dirty, sickly, wild-looking inhabitants."
(Faux's Journal, Nov. 1, 1818, <i>ib.</i> <span class="smcap">xi</span>, 213-14.) He describes Kentucky
houses as "miserable holes, having one room only," where "all cook,
eat, sleep, breed, and die, males and females, all together." (<i>Ib.</i> 185,
and see 202.)</p></div>

There was, however, a large and ever-increasing number who
hearkened to those wonderful men, the circuit-riding preachers, who
did so much to build up moral and religious America. Most people
belonged to some church, and at the camp meetings and revivals,
multitudes received conviction.

The student should carefully read the <i>Autobiography of Peter Cartwright</i>,
edited by W. P. Strickland. This book is an invaluable historical
source and is highly interesting. See also Schermerhorn and
Mills: <i>A Correct View of that part of the United States which lies west
of the Allegany Mountains, with regard to Religion and Morals.</i> <i>Great
Revival in the West</i>, by Catharine C. Cleveland, is a careful and trustworthy
account of religious conditions before the War of 1812. It
has a complete bibliography.</p></div>

true. Thus Europe, and especially the United Kingdom, conceived for
Americans that profound contempt which was to endure for generations.

analysis in 1820 (<span class="smcap">xxxiii</span>, 78-80) of a book entitled <i>Statistical Annals of
the United States</i>, by Adam Seybert. "He must not ... allow himself to
be dazzled by that galaxy of epithets by which his orators and newspaper
scribblers endeavour to persuade their supporters that they are
the greatest, the most refined, the most enlightened, and the most
moral people upon earth.... They have hitherto given no indications
of genius, and made no approaches to the heroic, either in their morality
or character....
</p><p>
"During the thirty or forty years of their independence, they have
done absolutely nothing for the Sciences, for the Arts, for Literature,
or even for statesman-like studies of Politics or Political Economy....
In the four quarters of the globe, who reads an American book? or
goes to an American play? or looks at an American picture or statue?
What does the world yet owe to American physicians or surgeons?
What new substances have their chemists discovered? or what old
ones have they analyzed? What new constellations have been discovered
by the telescopes of Americans?&mdash;what have they done in the
mathematics...? under which of the old tyrannical governments of
Europe is every sixth man a Slave, whom his fellow-creatures may buy
and sell and torture?"</p></div>

a [bank] company was formed, plates engraved, and the bank
notes brought to the spot." Failing to secure a charter, the adventurers
sold their outfit at auction, fictitious names were signed to the
notes, which were then put into fraudulent circulation. (Flint's Letters,

<h3>THE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE CASE</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Such a contract, in relation to a publick institution would be absurd and contrary
to the principles of all governments. (Chief Justice William M. Richardson.)
</p>

<p>It would seem as if the state legislatures have an invincible hostility to the
sacredness of charters. (Marshall.)</p>

<p>Perhaps no judicial proceedings in this country ever involved more important
consequences. (<i>North American Review</i>, 1820.)</p>

<p>It is the legitimate business of government to see that contracts are fulfilled,
that charters are kept inviolate, and the foundations of human confidence not
rudely or wantonly disturbed. (John Fiske.)</p></div>


<p>Just before Marshall delivered his opinion in Sturges
<i>vs.</i> Crowninshield, he gave to the Nation another
state paper which profoundly influenced the development
of the United States. It was one of the trilogy
of Constitutional expositions which make historic
the February term, 1819, of the Supreme Court of
the United States. This pronouncement, like that
in the bankruptcy case, had to do with the stability
of contract. Both were avowals that State Legislatures
cannot, on any pretext, overthrow agreements,
whether in the form of engagements between
individuals or franchises to corporations. Both were
meant to check the epidemic of repudiatory legislation
which for three years had been sweeping over
the land and was increasing in virulence at the time
when Marshall prepared them. The Dartmouth
opinion was wholly written in Virginia during the
summer, autumn, or winter of 1818; and it is
probable that the greater part of the opinion in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Sturges <i>vs.</i> Crowninshield was also prepared when
the Chief Justice was at home or on his vacation.</p>

<p>Marshall's economic and political views, formed
as a young man,<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> had been strengthened by every
event that had since occurred until, in his sixty-fifth
year, those early ideas had become convictions
so deep as to pervade his very being. The sacredness
of contract, the stability of institutions, and,
above all, Nationalism in government, were, to John
Marshall, articles of a creed as holy as any that ever
inspired a religious enthusiast.</p>

<p>His opinion of contract had already been expressed
by him not only in the sensational case of
Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck,<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> but far more rigidly two years
later, 1812, in the important case of the State of
New Jersey <i>vs.</i> Wilson.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> In 1758, the Proprietary
Government of New Jersey agreed to purchase a
tract of land for a band of Delaware Indians, provided
that the Indians would surrender their title
to all other lands claimed by them in New Jersey.
The Indians agreed and the contract was embodied
in an act of the Legislature, which further provided
that the lands purchased for the Indians should "not
hereafter be subject to any tax, any law, usage or
custom to the contrary thereof, in any wise notwithstanding."<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>
The contract was then executed, the
State purchasing lands for the Indians and the latter
relinquishing the lands claimed by them.</p>

<p>After forty years the Indians, wishing to join
other Delawares in New York, asked the State of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
New Jersey to authorize the sale of their lands. This
was done by an act of the Legislature, and the lands
were sold. Soon after this, another act was passed
which repealed that part of the Act of 1758 exempting
the lands from taxation. Accordingly the lands
were assessed and payment of the tax demanded.
The purchasers resisted and, the Supreme Court of
New Jersey having held valid the repealing act,
took the case to the Supreme Court of the United
States.</p>

<p>In a brief opinion, in which it is worthy of particular
note that the Supreme Court was unanimous,
Marshall says that the Constitution protects "contracts
to which a state is a party, as well as ...
contracts between individuals.... The proceedings
[of 1758] between the then colony ... and the Indians
... is certainly a contract clothed in forms of
unusual solemnity." The exemption of the lands
from taxation, "though for the benefit of the Indians,
is annexed, by the terms which create it, to the land
itself, not to their persons." This element of the
contract was valuable to the Indians, since, "in the
event of a sale, on which alone the question could
become material, the value [of the lands] would be
enhanced" by the exemption.</p>

<p>New Jersey "might have insisted on a surrender
of this privilege as the sole condition on which a sale
of the property should be allowed"; but this had
not been done and the land was sold "with the assent
of the state, with all its privileges and immunities.
The purchaser succeeds, with the assent of the state,
to all the rights of the Indians. He stands, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
respect to this land, in their place, and claims the
benefit of their contract. This contract is certainly
impaired by a law which would annul this essential
part of it."<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></p>

<p>After his opinions in Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck and in New
Jersey <i>vs.</i> Wilson, nobody could have expected from
John Marshall any other action than the one he
took in the Dartmouth College case.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p>The origins of the Dartmouth controversy are
tangled and obscure. When on December 23, 1765,
a little ocean-going craft, of which a New England
John Marshall<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> was skipper, set sail from Boston
Harbor for England with Nathaniel Whitaker and
Samson Occom on board,<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> a succession of curious
events began which, two generations afterward,
terminated in one of the most influential decisions
ever rendered by a court. Whitaker was a preacher
and a disciple of George Whitefield; Occom was
a young Indian, converted to Christianity by one
Eleazar Wheelock, and endowed with uncommon
powers of oratory.</p>

<p>Wheelock had built up a wilderness school to which
were admitted Indian youth, in whom he became
increasingly interested. Occom was one product of
his labors, and Wheelock sent him to England as
a living, speaking illustration of what his school<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
could do if given financial support. Whitaker went
with the devout and talented Indian as the business
agent.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></p>

<p>Their mission was to raise funds for the prosecution
of this educational and missionary work on the
American frontier. They succeeded in a manner
almost miraculous. Over eleven thousand pounds
were soon raised,<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> and this fund was placed under
the control of the Trustees, at the head of whom
was the Earl of Dartmouth, one of the principal
donors.<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> From this circumstance the name of this
nobleman was given to Wheelock's institution.</p>

<p>On December 13, 1769, John Wentworth, Royal
Governor of the Province of New Hampshire,
granted to Wheelock a charter for his school. It
was, of course, in the name of the sovereign, but it is
improbable that George III ever heard of it.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> This
charter sets forth the successful efforts of Wheelock,
"at his own expense, on his own estate," to establish
a charity school for Indian as well as white youth,
in order to spread "the knowledge of the great Redeemer
among their savage tribes"; the contributions
to the cause; the trust, headed by Dartmouth&mdash;and
all the other facts concerning Wheelock's
adventure. Because of these facts the charter
establishes "<span class="smcap">Dartmouth College</span>" for the education
of Indians, to be governed by "one body
corporate and politick, ... by the name of the
<span class="smcap">Trustees of Dartmouth College</span>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>These Trustees are constituted "forever hereafter
... in deed, act, and name a body corporate
and politick," and are empowered to buy, receive,
and hold lands, "jurisdictions, and franchises, for
themselves and their successors, in fee simple, or
otherwise howsoever." In short, the Trustees are
authorized to do anything and everything that they
may think proper. Wheelock is made President of
the College, and given power to "appoint, ... by his
last will" whomever he chooses to succeed himself
as President of the College.</p>

<p>The charter grants to the Trustees and to "their
successors forever," or "the major part of any seven
or more of them convened," the power to remove
and choose a President of the College, and to fill any
vacancy in the Board of Trustees occasioned by
death, or "removal," or any other cause. All this is
to be done if seven Trustees, or a majority of seven,
are present at any meeting. Also this majority of
seven of the twelve Trustees, if no more attend a
meeting, are authorized to make all laws, rules, and
regulations for the College. Other powers are
granted, all of which the Trustees and their successors
are "to have and to hold ... forever."<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>
Under this charter, Dartmouth College was established
and, for nearly half a century, governed and
managed.</p>

<p>Eleazar Wheelock died in 1779, when sixty-eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
years of age.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> By his will he made his son John his
successor as President of the College.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> This young
man, then but twenty-five years of age, was a Colonel
of the Revolutionary Army.<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> He hesitated to accept
the management of the institution, but the Trustees
finally prevailed upon him to do so.<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> The son was as
strong-willed and energetic as the father, and gave
himself vigorously to the work to which he had thus
been called.</p>

<p>Within four years troubles began to gather about
the College. They came from sources as strange as
human nature itself, and mingled at last into a compound
of animosities, prejudices, ambitions, jealousies,
as curious as any aggregation of passions ever
arranged by the most extravagant novelist. It is
possible here to mention but briefly only a few of the
circumstances by which the famous Dartmouth
quarrel may be traced. A woman, one Rachel Murch,
complained to the church at Hanover, where Dartmouth
College was situated, that a brother of the
congregation, one Samuel Haze, had said of her,
among other things, that her "character was ... as
black as Hell."<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> This incident grew into a sectarian
warfare that, by the most illogical and human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
processes, eventuated in arraigning the Congregationalists,
or "established" Church, on one side and
all other denominations on the other.<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>

<p>Into this religious quarrel the economic issue entered,
as it always does. The property of ministers
of the "standing order," or "State religion," was
exempt from taxation while that of other preachers
was not.<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> Another source of discord arose out of
the question as to whether the College Professor of
Theology should preach in the village church. Coincident
with this grave problem were subsidiary ones
concerning the attendance of students at village
worship and the benches they were to occupy. The
fates threw still another ingredient of trouble into
the cauldron. This was the election in 1793, as one
of the Trustees, of Nathaniel Niles, whom Jefferson,
with characteristic exuberance of expression, once
declared to be "the ablest man I ever knew."<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a></p>

<p>Although a lawyer by profession, Niles had taken
a course in theology when a student, his instructor
being a Dr. Joseph Bellamy. Both the elder Wheelock
and Bellamy had graduated from Yale and had
indulged in some bitter sectarian quarrels, Bellamy
as a Congregationalist and Wheelock as a Presbyterian.
From tutor and parent, Niles and the younger
Wheelock inherited this religious antagonism. Moreover,
they were as antipathetic by nature as they
were bold, uncompromising, and dominant. Niles
eventually acquired superior influence over his fel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>low
Trustees, and thereafter no friend of President
Wheelock was elected to the Board.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></p>

<p>An implacable feud arose. Wheelock asked the
Legislature to appoint a committee to investigate
the conduct of the College. This further angered the
Trustees. By this time the warfare in the one college
in the State had aroused the interest of the
people of New Hampshire and, indeed, of all New
England, and they were beginning to take sides.
This process was hastened by a furious battle of
pamphlets which broke out in 1815. This logomachy
of vituperation was opened by President Wheelock
who wrote an unsigned attack upon the Trustees.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>
Another pamphlet followed immediately in support
of that of Wheelock.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></p>

<p>The Trustees quickly answered by means of two
pamphlets.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> The Wheelock faction instantly replied.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>
With the animosity and diligence of political,
religious, and personal enemies, the adherents of the
hostile factions circulated these pamphlets among
the people, who became greatly excited. On August
26, 1815, the Trustees removed Wheelock from the
office of President,<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> and thereby increased the public
agitation. Two days after Wheelock's removal, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Trustees elected as his successor the Reverend Francis
Brown of Yarmouth, Maine.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></p>

<p>During these years of increasing dissension, political
parties were gradually drawn into the controversy;
at the climax of it, the Federalists found
themselves supporting the cause of the Trustees and
the Republicans that of Wheelock. In a general, and
yet quite definite, way the issue shaped itself into the
maintenance of chartered rights and the established
religious order, as against reform in college management
and equality of religious sects. Into this issue
was woven a contest over the State Judiciary. The
Judiciary laws of New Hampshire were confused and
inadequate and the courts had fallen in dignity.
During the Republican control of the State, Republicans
had been appointed to all judicial positions.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>
When, in 1813, the Federalists recovered supremacy,
they, in turn, enacted a statute, the effect of
which was the ousting of the Republican judges and
the appointment of Federalists in their stead.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> The
Republicans made loud and savage outcry against
this Federalist "outrage."</p>

<p>Upon questions so absurdly incongruous a political
campaign raged throughout New Hampshire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
during the autumn and winter of 1815. In March,
1816, the Republicans elected William Plumer Governor,<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
and a Republican majority was sent to the
Legislature.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> Bills for the reform of the Judiciary<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>
and the management of Dartmouth College<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> were
introduced. That relating to Dartmouth changed
the name of the College to "Dartmouth University,"
increased the number of Trustees from twelve to
twenty-one, provided for a Board of twenty-five
Overseers with a veto power over acts of the Trustees,
and directed the President of the "University"
to report annually to the Governor of the State<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
upon the management and conditions of the institution.
The Governor and Council of State were
empowered to appoint the Overseers; to fill up the
existing Board of Trustees to the number of twenty-one;
and authorized to inspect the "University"
and report to the Legislature concerning it at least
once in every five years.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> In effect the act annulled
the charter and brought the College under the control
of the Legislature.</p>

<p>The bitterness occasioned by the passage of this
legislation was intense. Seventy-five members of the
House entered upon the Journal their formal and
emphatic protest.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> The old Trustees adopted elaborate
resolutions, declining to accept the provisions
of the law and assigning many reasons for their
action. Among their criticisms of the act, the fact
that it violated the contract clause of the National
Constitution was mentioned almost incidentally. In
summing up their argument, the Trustees declared
that "if the act ... has its intended operation and
effect, every literary institution in the State will
hereafter hold its rights, privileges and property,
not according to the settled established principles
of law, but according to the arbitrary will and pleasure
of every successive Legislature."<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>In later resolutions the old Trustees declined to
accept the provisions of the law, "but do hereby expressly
refuse to act under the same."<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> The Governor
and Council promptly appointed Trustees and
Overseers of the new University; among the latter
was Joseph Story. The old Trustees were defiant
and continued to run the College. When the winter
session of the Legislature met, Governor Plumer
sharply denounced their action;<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> and two laws were
passed for the enforcement of the College Acts, the
second of which provided that any person assuming
to act as trustee or officer of the College, except
as provided by law, should be fined $500 for each
offense.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a></p>

<p>The Trustees of the University "removed" the old
Trustees of the College and the President, and the
professors who adhered to them.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> Each side took
its case to the people.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> The new r&eacute;gime ousted
the old faculty from the College buildings and the
faculty of the University were installed in them.
Wheelock was elected President of the State institution.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>
The College faculty procured quarters in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
Rowley Hall near by, and there continued their
work, the students mostly adhering to them.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></p>

<p>The College Trustees took great pains to get the
opinion of the best lawyers throughout New Hampshire,<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>
as well as the advice of their immediate counsel,
Jeremiah Mason, Jeremiah Smith, and Daniel
Webster, the three ablest members of the New England
bar, all three of them accomplished politicians.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></p>

<p>William H. Woodward, who for years had been
Secretary and Treasurer of the College, had in his
possession the records, account books, and seal. As
one of the Wheelock faction he declined to recognize
the College Trustees and acted with the Board of
the University. The College Trustees removed him
from his official position on the College Board;<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> and
on February 8, 1817, brought suit against him in the
Court of Common Pleas of Grafton County for the
recovery of the original charter, the books of record
and account, and the common seal&mdash;all of the value<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
of $50,000. By the consent of the parties the case
was taken directly before the Superior Court of
Appeals, and was argued upon an agreed state of
facts returned by the jury in the form of a special
verdict.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p>There were two arguments in the Court of Appeals,
the first during May and the second during
September, 1817. The court consisted of William
M. Richardson, Chief Justice, and Samuel Bell and
Levi Woodbury, Associate Justices, all Republicans
appointed by Governor Plumer.</p>

<p>Mason, Smith, and Webster made uncommonly
able and learned arguments. The University was
represented by George Sullivan and Ichabod Bartlett,
who, while good lawyers, were no match for the
legal triumvirate that appeared for the College.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>
The principle upon which Marshall finally overthrew
the New Hampshire law was given a minor place<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>
in the plans as well as in the arguments of Webster,
Mason, and Smith.</p>

<p>The Superior Court of Appeals decided against the
College. The opinion, delivered by Chief Justice
Richardson, is able and persuasive. "A corporation,
all of whose franchises are exercised for publick purposes,
is a publick corporation"&mdash;a gift to such a
corporation "is in reality a gift to the publick."<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
corporation of Dartmouth College is therefore public.
"Who has any private interest either in the objects
or the property of this institution?" If all its "property
... were destroyed, the loss would be exclusively
publick." The Trustees, as individuals, would lose
nothing. "The office of trustee of Dartmouth College
is, in fact, a publick trust, as much so as the
office of governor, or of judge of this court."<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>

<p>No provision in the State or National Constitution
prevents the control of the College by the
Legislature. The Constitutional provisions cited by
counsel for the College<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> "were, most manifestly, intended
to protect private rights only."<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> No court
has ever yet decided that such a charter as that of
Dartmouth College is in violation of the contract
clause of the National Constitution, which "was
obviously intended to protect private rights of property,
and embraces all contracts relating to private
property." This clause "was not intended to limit
the power of the states" over their officers or "their
own civil institutions";<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> otherwise divorce laws
would be void. So would acts repealing or modifying
laws under which the judges, sheriffs, and other
officers were appointed.</p>

<p>Even if the royal charter is a contract, it does not,
cannot forever, prevent the Legislature from modifying
it for the general good (as, for instance, by increasing
the number of trustees) "however strongly
the publick interest might require" this to be done.
"Such a contract, in relation to a publick institution,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
would ... be absurd and repugnant to the principles
of all government. The king had no power to make
such a contract," and neither has the Legislature.
If the act of June 27 had provided that "the twenty-one
trustees should forever have the exclusive controul
of this institution, and that no future legislature
should add to their number," it would be as
invalid as an act that the "number of judges of this
court should never be augmented."<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p>

<p>It is against "sound policy," Richardson affirmed,
to place the great institutions of learning "within
the absolute controul of a few individuals, and out
of the controul of the sovereign power.... It is a
matter of too great moment, too intimately connected
with the publick welfare and prosperity, to
be thus entrusted in the hands of a few."<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> So the
New Hampshire court adjudged that the College
Acts were valid and binding upon the old Trustees
"without acceptance thereof, or assent thereto by
them." And the court specifically declared that
such legislation was "not repugnant to the constitution
of the United States."<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a></p>

<p>Immediately the case was taken to the Supreme
Court by writ of error, which assigned the violation
of the National Constitution by the College Acts as
the ground of appeal.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> On March 10, 1818, Webster
opened the argument before a full bench.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> Only a
few auditors were present, and these were lawyers<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
who were in Washington to argue other cases.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>
Stirred as New Hampshire and the New England
States were by the College controversy, the remainder
of the country appears to have taken no interest
in it. Indeed, west and south of the Hudson, the
people seem to have known nothing of the quarrel.
The Capital was either ignorant or indifferent.
Moreover, Webster had not, as yet, made that great
reputation, in Washington, as a lawyer as well as an
orator which, later, became his peculiar crown of
glory. At any rate, the public was not drawn to the
court-room on that occasion.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a></p>

<p>The argument was one of the shortest ever made
in a notable case before the Supreme Court during
the twenty-eight years of its existence up to this
time. Not three full days were consumed by counsel
on both sides&mdash;a space of time frequently occupied
by a single speaker in hearings of important causes.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a></p>

<p>In talents, bearing, and preparation the attorneys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
for the College were as much superior to those for the
University as, in the Chase impeachment trial, the
counsel for the defense were stronger than the House
managers.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> Indeed, the similarity of the arguments
in the Chase trial and in the Dartmouth case, in respect
to the strength and preparation of opposing
counsel, is notable; and in both cases the victory
came to the side having the abler and better-prepared
advocates. With Webster for the College was Joseph
Hopkinson of Philadelphia, who had so distinguished
himself in the Chase trial exactly thirteen years
earlier. Hopkinson was now in his forty-ninth year,
the unrivaled leader of the Philadelphia bar and
one of the most accomplished of American lawyers.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

<p>It would seem incredible that sensible men could
have selected such counsel to argue serious questions
before any court as those who represented the University
in this vitally important controversy. The
obvious explanation is that the State officials and the
University Trustees were so certain of winning that
they did not consider the employment of powerful
and expensive attorneys to be necessary.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> In fact,
the belief was general that the contest was practi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>cally
over and that the appeal of the College to the
Supreme Court was the pursuit of a feeble and forlorn
hope.</p>

<p>Even after his powerful and impressive argument
in the Supreme Court, Webster declared that he had
never allowed himself "to indulge any great hopes
of success."<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> It was not unnatural, then, that the
State and the University should neglect to employ
adequate counsel.</p>

<p>John Holmes, a Representative in Congress from
that part of Massachusetts which afterward became
the State of Maine, appeared for the University. He
was notoriously unfitted to argue a legal question
of any weight in any court. He was a busy, agile,
talkative politician of the roustabout, hail-fellow-well-met
variety, "a power-on-the-stump" orator,
gifted with cheap wit and tawdry eloquence.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></p>

<p>Associated with Holmes was William Wirt, recently
appointed Attorney-General. At that particular
time Wirt was all but crushed by overwork, and
without either leisure or strength to master the case
and prepare an argument.<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> Never in Wirt's life did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
he appear in any case so poorly equipped as he was
in the Dartmouth controversy.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p>Webster's address was a combination of the arguments
made by Mason and Smith in the New Hampshire
court. Although the only question before
the Supreme Court was whether the College Acts
violated the contract clause of the Constitution,
Webster gave comparatively scant attention to it;
or, perhaps it might be said that most of his argument
was devoted to laying the foundation for his
brief reasoning on the main question. In laying
this foundation, Webster cleverly brought before
the court his version of the history of the College,
the situation in New Hampshire, the plight of institutions
like Dartmouth, if the College Acts were
permitted to stand.</p>

<p>The facts were, said Webster, that Wheelock had
founded a private charity; that, to perpetuate this,
the charter created a corporation by the name of
"The Trustees of Dartmouth College," with the
powers, privileges, immunities, and limitations set
forth in the charter. That instrument provided for
no public funds, but only for the perpetuation and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
convenient management of the private charity. For
nearly half a century the College "thus created had
existed, uninterruptedly, and usefully." Then its
happy and prosperous career was broken by the
rude and despoiling hands of the Legislature of
the State which the College had so blessed by the
education of New Hampshire youth.</p>

<p>What has the Legislature done to the College?
It has created a new corporation and transferred to
it "all the <i>property</i>, <i>rights</i>, <i>powers</i>, <i>liberties and privileges</i>
of the old corporation." The spirit and the letter
of the charter were wholly changed by the College
Acts.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> Moreover, the old Trustees "are to be
<i>punished</i>" for not accepting these revolutionary
laws. A single fact reveals the confiscatory nature
of these statutes: Under the charter the president,
professors, and tutors of the College had a right to
their places and salaries, "subject to the twelve
trustees alone"; the College Acts change all this and
make the faculty "accountable to new masters."</p>

<p>If the Legislature can make such alterations, it
can abolish the charter "rights and privileges altogether."
In short, if this legislation is sustained, the
old Trustees "have no <i>rights</i>, <i>liberties</i>, <i>franchises</i>,
<i>property or privileges</i>, which the legislature may not
revoke, annul, alienate or transfer to others whenever
it sees fit." Such acts are against "common
right" as well as violations of the State and National
Constitutions.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a></p>

<p>Although, says Webster, nothing is before the court<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
but the single question of the violation of the National
Constitution, he will compare the New Hampshire
laws with "fundamental principles" in order
that the court may see "their true nature and character."
Regardless of written constitutions, "these
acts are not the exercise of a power properly legislative."
They take away "vested rights"; but this
involves a "forfeiture ... to ... declare which is the
proper province of the judiciary."<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> Dartmouth College
is not a civil but "an <i>eleemosynary</i> corporation,"
a "private charity"; and, as such, not subject to the
control of public authorities.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> Does Dartmouth College
stand alone in this respect? No! Practically all
American institutions of learning have been "established
... by incorporating governours, or trustees....
All such corporations are ... in the strictest legal
sense a private charity." Even Harvard has not
"any surer title than Dartmouth College. It may,
to-day, have more friends; but to-morrow it may
have more enemies. Its legal rights are the same. So
also of Yale College; and indeed of all others."<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

<p>From the time of Magna Charta the privilege of
being a member of such eleemosynary corporations
"has been the object of legal protection." To contend
that this privilege may be "taken away," because
the Trustees derive no "pecuniary benefit"
from it, is "an extremely narrow view." As well say
that if the charter had provided that each Trustee
should be given a "commission on the disbursement
of the funds," his status and the nature of the cor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>poration
would have been changed from public to
private. Are the rights of the Trustees any the less
sacred "because they have undertaken to administer
it [the trust] gratuitously?... As if the law
regarded no rights but the rights of money, and of
visible tangible property!"<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<p>The doctrine that all property "of which the use
may be beneficial to the publick, belongs therefore
to the publick," is without principle or precedent.
In this very matter of Dartmouth College, Wheelock
might well have "conveyed his property to trustees,
for precisely such uses as are described in this charter"&mdash;yet
nobody would contend that any Legislature
could overthrow such a private act. "Who ever
appointed a legislature to administer his charity?
Or who ever heard, before, that a gift to a <i>college</i>,
or <i>hospital</i>, or an <i>asylum</i>, was, in reality, nothing
but a gift to the state?"<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

<p>Vermont has given lands to the College; was this
a gift to New Hampshire? "What hinders Vermont
... from resuming her grants," upon the ground that
she, equally with New Hampshire, is "the representative
of the publick?" In 1794, Vermont had
"granted to the respective towns in that state, certain
glebe lands lying within those towns <i>for the sole
use and support of religious worship</i>." Five years
later, the Legislature of that State repealed this
grant; "but this court declared<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> that the act of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
1794, 'so far as it granted the glebes to the towns,
<i>could not afterwards be repealed by the legislature, so
as to divest the rights of the towns under the grant</i>.'"<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<p>So with the Trustees of Dartmouth College. The
property entrusted to them was "private property";
and the right to "administer the funds, and ... govern
the college was a <i>franchise</i> and <i>privilege</i>, solemnly
granted to them," which no Legislature can
annul. "The use being publick in no way diminishes
their legal estate in the property, or their title to the
franchise." Since "the acts in question violate property,
... take away privileges, immunities, and franchises,
... deny to the trustees the protection of the
law," and "are retrospective in their operation,"
they are, in all respects, "against the constitution
of New Hampshire."<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

<p>It will be perceived by now that Webster relied
chiefly on abstract justice. His main point was that,
if chartered rights could be interfered with at all,
such action was inherently beyond the power of the
Legislature, and belonged exclusively to the Judiciary.
In this Webster was rigidly following Smith
and Mason, neither of whom depended on the violation
of the contract clause of the National Constitution
any more than did Webster.</p>

<p>Well did Webster know that the Supreme Court of
the United States could not consider the violation
of a State constitution by a State law. He merely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
indulged in a device of argument to bring before Marshall
and the Associate Justices those "fundamental
principles," old as Magna Charta, and embalmed
in the State Constitution, which protect private
property from confiscation.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> Toward the close of his
argument, Webster discusses the infraction of the
National Constitution by the New Hampshire College
Acts, a violation the charge of which alone gave
the Supreme Court jurisdiction over the case.</p>

<p>What, asks Webster, is the meaning of the words,
"no state shall pass any ... law impairing the obligation
of contracts"? Madison, in the <i>Federalist</i>,
clearly states that such laws "'are contrary to the
first principles of the social compact, and to every
principle of sound legislation.'" But this is not
enough. "Our own experience," continues Madison,
"has taught us ... that additional fences" should
be erected against spoliations of "personal security
and private rights." This was the reason for inserting
the contract clause in the National Constitution&mdash;a
provision much desired by the "sober
people of America," who had grown "weary of the
fluctuating policy" of the State Governments and
beheld with anger "that sudden changes, and legislative
interferences in cases affecting personal
rights, become jobs in the hands of enterprising and
influential speculators." These, said Webster, were
the words of James Madison in Number 44 of the
<i>Federalist</i>.</p>

<p>High as such authority is, one still more exalted
and final has spoken, and upon the precise point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
now in controversy. That authority is the Supreme
Court itself. In Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> this very tribunal
declared specifically that "a <i>grant</i> is a contract,
within the meaning of this provision; and that
a grant by a state is also a contract, as much as the
grant of an individual."<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> This court went even
further when, in New Jersey <i>vs.</i> Wilson,<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> it decided
that "a grant by a state before the revolution is as
much to be protected as a grant since."<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> The principle
announced in these decisions was not new,
even in America. Even before Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck and
New Jersey <i>vs.</i> Wilson, this court denied<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> that a
Legislature "can repeal statutes creating private
corporations, or confirming to them property already
acquired under the faith of previous laws, and
by such repeal can vest the property of such corporations
exclusively in the state, or dispose of the
same to such purposes as they please, without the
consent or default of the corporators ...; and we
think ourselves standing upon the principles of
<i>natural justice</i>, upon the <i>fundamental laws of every
free government</i>, upon the spirit and letter of the
constitution of the United States, and upon the
decisions of the most respectable judicial tribunals,
in resisting such a doctrine."<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p>

<p>From the beginning of our Government until this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
very hour, continues Webster, such has been the uniform
language of this honorable court. The principle
that a Legislature cannot "repeal statutes
creating private corporations" must be considered
as settled. It follows, then, that if a Legislature cannot
repeal such laws entirely, it cannot repeal them
in part&mdash;cannot "impair them, or essentially alter
them without the consent of the corporators."<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> In
the case last cited<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> the property granted was land;
but the Dartmouth charter "is embraced within the
very terms of that decision," since "a grant of corporate
powers and privileges is as much a <i>contract</i> as
a grant of land."<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a></p>

<p>Even the State court concedes that if Dartmouth
College is a private corporation, "its rights stand on
the same ground as those of an individual"; and
that tribunal rests its judgment against the College
on the sole ground that it is a public corporation.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p>

<p>Dartmouth College is not the only institution
affected by this invasion of chartered rights. "Every
college, and all the literary institutions of the
country" are imperiled. All of them exist because
of "the inviolability of their charters." Shall their
fate depend upon "the rise and fall of popular
parties, and the fluctuations of political opinions"?
If so, "colleges and halls will ... become a theatre
for the contention of politicks. Party and faction
will be cherished in the places consecrated to piety
and learning."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>"We had hoped, earnestly hoped," exclaimed
Webster, "that the State court would protect Dartmouth
College. That hope has failed. It is here,
that those rights are now to be maintained, or they
are prostrated forever." He closed with a long Latin
quotation, not a word of which Marshall understood,
but which, delivered in Webster's sonorous tones
and with Webster's histrionic power, must have
been prodigiously impressive.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a></p>

<p>Undoubtedly it was at this point that the incomparable
actor, lawyer, and orator added to his prepared
peroration that dramatic passage which has
found a permanent place in the literature of emotional
eloquence. Although given to the world a
quarter of a century after Webster's speech was delivered,
and transmitted through two men of vivid
and creative imaginations, there certainly is some
foundation for the story. Rufus Choate in his "Eulogy
of Webster," delivered at Dartmouth College in
1853, told, for the first time, of the incident as narrated
to him by Professor Chauncey A. Goodrich,
who heard Webster's argument. When Webster had
apparently finished, says Goodrich, he "stood for
some moments silent before the Court, while every
eye was fixed intently upon him." At length, addressing
the Chief Justice, Webster delivered that
famous peroration ending: "'Sir, you may destroy
this little Institution; it is weak; it is in your hands!
I know it is one of the lesser lights in the literary
horizon of our country. You may put it out. But
if you do so, you must carry through your work!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
You must extinguish, one after another, all those
great lights of science which, for more than a century,
have thrown their radiance over our land!</p>

<p>"'It is, Sir, as I have said, a small College. And
yet, <i>there are those who love it</i>&mdash;&mdash;'"<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a></p>

<p>Then, testifies Goodrich, Webster broke down
with emotion, his lips quivered, his cheeks trembled,
his eyes filled with tears, his voice choked. In a
"few broken words of tenderness" he spoke of his
love for Dartmouth in such fashion that the listeners
were impressed with "the recollections of father,
mother, brother, and all the trials and privations
through which he had made his way into life."<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<p>Goodrich describes the scene in the court-room,
"during these two or three minutes," thus: "Chief
Justice Marshall, with his tall and gaunt figure bent
over as if to catch the slightest whisper, the deep
furrows of his cheek expanded with emotion, and
eyes suffused with tears; Mr. Justice Washington
at his side,&mdash;with his small and emaciated frame,
and countenance more like marble than I ever saw
on any other human being,&mdash;leaning forward with
an eager, troubled look; and the remainder of the
Court, at the two extremities, pressing, as it were,
toward a single point, while the audience below
were wrapping themselves round in closer folds
beneath the bench to catch each look, and every
movement of the speaker's face." Recovering "his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
composure, and fixing his keen eye on the Chief
Justice," Webster, "in that deep tone with which
he sometimes thrilled the heart of an audience,"
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"'Sir, I know not how others may feel,' (glancing
at the opponents of the College before him,) 'but,
for myself, when I see my Alma Mater surrounded,
like C&aelig;sar in the senate-house, by those who are
reiterating stab upon stab, I would not, for this
right hand, have her turn to me, and say, <i>Et tu
quoque, mi fili!</i>'"<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a></p>

<p>Exclusive of his emotional finish, Webster's whole
address was made up from the arguments of Jeremiah
Mason and Jeremiah Smith in the State court.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> This
fact Webster privately admitted, although he never
publicly gave his associates the credit.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>When Farrar's "Report," containing Mason's argument,
was published, Story wrote Mason that he
was "exceedingly pleased" with it. "I always had
a desire that the question should be put upon the
broad basis you have stated; and it was a matter
of regret that we were so stinted in jurisdiction in
the Supreme Court, that half the argument could
not be met and enforced. You need not fear a comparison
of your argument with any in our annals."<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>
Thus Story makes plain, what is apparent on the
face of his own and Marshall's opinion, that he
considered the master question involved to be that
the College Acts were violative of fundamental
principles of government. Could the Supreme Court
have passed upon the case without regard to the
Constitution, there can be no doubt that the decision
would have been against the validity of the
New Hampshire laws upon the ground on which
Mason, Smith, and Webster chiefly relied.</p>

<p>Webster, as we have seen, had little faith in winning
on the contract clause and was nervously
anxious that the controversy should be presented to
the Supreme Court by means of a case which would
give that tribunal greater latitude than was afforded
by the "stinted jurisdiction" of which Story complained.
Indeed, Story openly expressed impatience
that the court was restricted to a consideration of
the contract clause. Upon his return to Massa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>chusetts
after the argument, Story as much as told
Webster that another suit should be brought which
could be taken to the Supreme Court, and which
would permit the court to deal with all the questions
raised by the New Hampshire College Acts. Webster's
report of this conversation is vital to an understanding
of the views of the Chief Justice, as well
as of those of Story, since the latter undoubtedly
stated Marshall's views as well as his own. "I saw
Judge Story as I came along," Webster reported to
Mason. "He is evidently expecting a case which
shall present all the questions. It is not of great
consequence whether the actions or action, go up at
this term, except that it would give it an earlier
standing on the docket next winter.</p>

<p>"The question which we must raise in one of
these actions, is, 'whether, by the <i>general principles
of our governments</i>, the State Legislatures be not
restrained from divesting vested rights?' This, of
course, independent of the constitutional provision
respecting contracts. On this question [the maintenance
of vested rights by "general principles"] I
have great confidence in a decision on the right side.
This is the proposition with which you began your
argument at Exeter, and which I endeavored to
state from your minutes at Washington.... On
<i>general</i> principles, I am very confident the court at
Washington would be with us."<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>Holmes followed Webster. "The God-like Daniel"
could not have wished for a more striking contrast
to himself. In figure, bearing, voice, eye, intellect,
and personality, the Maine Congressman, politician,
and stump-speaker, was the antithesis of Webster.
For three hours Holmes declaimed "the merest stuff
that was ever uttered in a county court."<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> His
"argument" was a diffuse and florid repetition of
the opinion of Chief Justice Richardson, and was
one of those empty and long-winded speeches which
Marshall particularly disliked.</p>

<p>Wirt did his best to repair the damage done by
Holmes; but he was so indifferently prepared,<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
so physically exhausted, that, breaking down in the
midst of his address, he asked the court to adjourn
that he might finish next day;<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> and this the bored
and weary Justices were only too willing to do. Wirt
added nothing to the reasoning and facts of Richardson's
opinion which was in the hands of Marshall
and his associates.</p>

<p>The argument was closed by Joseph Hopkinson;
and here again Fate acted as stage manager for Dartmouth,
since the author of "Hail Columbia"<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> was as
handsome and impressive a man as Webster, though
of an exactly opposite type. His face was that of the
lifelong student, thoughtful and refined. His voice,
though light, had a golden tone. His manner was
quiet, yet distinguished.</p>

argument.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> He quite justified Webster's assurance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
to Brown that "Mr. Hopkinson ... will do all
that man can do."<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p>

<p>At eleven o'clock of March 13, 1818, the morning
after the argument was concluded, Marshall announced
that some judges were of "different opinions,
and that some judges had not formed opinions;
consequently, the cause must be continued."<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> On
the following day the court adjourned.</p>

<p>Marshall, Washington, and Story<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> were for the
College, Duval and Todd were against it, and Livingston
and Johnson had not made up their minds.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>
During the year that intervened before the court
again met in February, 1819, hope sprang up in the
hearts of Dartmouth's friends, and they became incessantly
active in every legitimate way. Webster's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
argument was printed and placed in the hands of
all influential lawyers in New England.</p>

<p>Chancellor James Kent of New York was looked
upon by the bench and bar of the whole country as
the most learned of American jurists and, next to
Marshall, the ablest.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> The views of no other judge
were so sought after by his fellow occupants of the
bench. Charles Marsh of New Hampshire, one of
the Trustees of the College and a warm friend of
Kent, sent him Webster's argument. While on a vacation
in Vermont Kent had read the opinion of Chief
Justice Richardson and, "on a hasty perusal of it,"
was at first inclined to think the College Acts valid,
because he was "led by the opinion to assume the
fact that Dartmouth College was a public establishment
for purposes of a general nature."<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> Webster's
argument changed Kent's views.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1818, Justice Johnson, of
the National Supreme Court, was in Albany, where
Kent lived, and conferred with the Chancellor about
the Dartmouth case. Kent told Johnson that he
thought the New Hampshire College Acts to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
against natural right and in violation of the contract
clause of the National Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> It seems
fairly certain also that Livingston asked for the
Chancellor's opinion, and was influenced by it.</p>

<p>Webster sent Story, with whom he was on terms
of cordial intimacy, "five copies of our argument."
Evidently Webster now knew that Story was unalterably
for the College, for he adds these otherwise
startling sentences: "If you send one of them
to each of such of the judges as you think proper, you
will of course do it in the manner least likely to lead
to a feeling that any indecorum has been committed
by the plaintiffs."<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></p>

<p>In some way, probably from the fact that Story
was an intimate friend of Plumer, a rumor had
spread, before the case was argued, that he was
against the College Trustees. Doubtless this impression
was strengthened by the fact that Governor
Plumer had appointed Story one of the Board
of Overseers of the new University. No shrewder
politician than Plumer ever was produced by New
England. But Story declined the appointment.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> He
had been compromised, however, in the eyes of
both sides. The friends of the College were discouraged,
angered, frightened.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> In great apprehension,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Charles Marsh, one of the College Trustees, wrote
Hopkinson of Story's appointment as Overseer of
the University and of the rumor in circulation. Hopkinson
answered heatedly that he would object to
Story's sitting in the case if the reports could be
confirmed.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></p>

<p>Although the efforts of the College to get its case
before Kent were praiseworthy rather than reprehensible,
and although no smallest item of testimony
had been adduced by eager searchers for something
unethical, nevertheless out of the circumstances just
related has been woven, from the materials of eager
imaginations, a network of suspicion involving the
integrity of the Supreme Court in the Dartmouth
decision.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the news had spread of the humiliating
failure before the Supreme Court of the flamboyant
Holmes and the tired and exhausted Wirt as
contrasted with the splendid efforts of Webster and
Hopkinson. The New Hampshire officials and the
University at last realized the mistake they had made
in not employing able counsel, and resolved to remedy
their blunder by securing the acknowledged
leader of the American bar whose primacy no judge
or lawyer in the country denied. They did what
they should have done at the beginning&mdash;they retained
William Pinkney of Maryland.</p>

<p>Traveling with him in the stage during the
autumn of 1818, Hopkinson learned that the great
lawyer had been engaged by the University. Moreover,
with characteristic indiscretion, Pinkney told
Hopkinson that he intended to request a reargument
at the approaching session of the Supreme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Court. In alarm, Hopkinson instantly wrote Webster,<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>
who was dismayed by the news. Of all men
the one Webster did not want to meet in forensic
combat was the legal Colossus from Baltimore.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a></p>

<p>Pinkney applied himself to the preparation of the
case with a diligence and energy uncommon even for
that most laborious and painstaking of lawyers. Apparently
he had no doubt that the Supreme Court
would grant his motion for a reargument. It was
generally believed that some of the Justices had
not made up their minds; rearguments, under such
circumstances, were usually granted and sometimes
required by the court; and William Pinkney was
the most highly regarded by that tribunal of all
practitioners before it. So, on February 1, 1819, he
took the Washington stage at Baltimore, prepared at
every point for the supreme effort of his brilliant
career.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

<p>Pinkney's purpose was, of course, well advertised
by this time. By nobody was it better understood
than by Marshall and, indeed, by every Justice of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
the Supreme Court. All of them, except Duval and
Todd, had come to an agreement and consented to
the opinion which Marshall had prepared since the
adjournment the previous year.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> None of them were
minded to permit the case to be reopened. Most
emphatically John Marshall was not.</p>

<p>When, at eleven o'clock, February 2, 1819, the
marshal of the court announced "The Honorable,
the Chief Justice and the Associate Justices of the
Supreme Court of the United States," Marshall, at
the head of his robed associates, walked to his place,
he beheld Pinkney rise, as did all others in the room,
to greet the court. Well did Marshall know that, at
the first opportunity, Pinkney would ask for a reargument.</p>

<p>From all accounts it would appear that Pinkney
was in the act of addressing the court when the Chief
Justice, seemingly unaware of his presence, placidly
announced that the court had come to a decision and
began reading his momentous opinion.<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> After a few
introductory sentences the Chief Justice came abruptly
to the main point of the dispute:</p>

<p>"This court can be insensible neither to the magnitude
nor delicacy of this question. The validity of
a legislative act is to be examined; and the opinion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
of the highest law tribunal of a state is to be revised:
an opinion which carries with it intrinsic evidence
of the diligence, of the ability, and the integrity,
with which it was formed. On more than one occasion
this court has expressed the cautious circumspection
with which it approaches the consideration
of such questions; and has declared that, in no doubtful
case would it pronounce a legislative act to be
contrary to the constitution.</p>

<p>"But the American people have said, in the constitution
of the United States, that 'no state shall pass
any bill of attainder, <i>ex post facto</i> law, or law impairing
the obligation of contracts.' In the same
instrument they have also said, 'that the judicial
power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising
under the constitution.' On the judges of this
court, then, is imposed the high and solemn duty of
protecting, from even legislative violation, those
contracts which the constitution of our country
has placed beyond legislative control; and, however
irksome the task may be, this is a duty from which
we dare not shrink."<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a></p>

<p>Then Marshall, with, for him, amazing brevity,
states the essential provisions of the charter and of
the State law that modified it;<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> and continues, almost
curtly: "It can require no argument to prove
that the circumstances of this case constitute a
contract." On the faith of the charter "large contributions"
to "a religious and literary institution"
are conveyed to a corporation created by that charter.
Indeed, in the very application it is stated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
that these funds will be so applied. "Surely in this
transaction every ingredient of a complete and legitimate
contract is to be found."<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a></p>

<p>This being so, is such a contract "protected" by
the Constitution, and do the New Hampshire College
Acts impair that contract? Marshall states clearly
and fairly Chief Justice Richardson's argument that
to construe the contract clause so broadly as to
cover the Dartmouth charter would prevent legislative
control of public offices, and even make divorce
laws invalid; and that the intention of the
framers of the Constitution was to confine the operation
of the contract clause to the protection of
property rights, as the history of the times plainly
shows.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>

<p>All this, says Marshall, "may be admitted." The
contract clause "never has been understood to embrace
other contracts than those which respect property,
or some object of value, and confer rights which
may be asserted in a court of justice." Divorce laws
are not included, of course&mdash;they merely enable a
court, "not to impair a marriage contract, but to liberate
one of the parties because it has been broken
by the other."</p>

<p>The "point on which the cause essentially depends"
is "the true construction" of the Dartmouth
charter. If that instrument grants "political power,"
creates a "civil institution" as an instrument of
government; "if the funds of the college be public
property," or if the State Government "be alone interested
in its transactions," the Legislature may do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
what it likes "unrestrained" by the National Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

<p>If, on the other hand, Dartmouth "be a private
eleemosynary institution," empowered to receive
property "for objects unconnected with government,"
and "whose funds are bestowed by individuals
on the faith of the charter; if the donors
have stipulated for the future disposition and management
of those funds in the manner prescribed
by themselves," the case becomes more difficult.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>
Marshall then sets out compactly and clearly the
facts relating to the establishment of Wheelock's
school; the granting and acceptance of the charter;
the nature of the College funds which "consisted entirely
of private donations." These facts unquestionably
show, he avows, that Dartmouth College
is "an eleemosynary, and, as far as respects its
funds, a private corporation."<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

<p>Does the fact that the purpose of the College is
the education of youth make it a public corporation?
It is true that the Government may found
and control an institution of learning. "But is
Dartmouth College such an institution? Is education
altogether in the hands of government?" Are
all teachers public officers? Do gifts for the advancement
of learning "necessarily become public
property, so far that the will of the legislature, not
the will of the donor, becomes the law of donation?"<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>Certainly Eleazar Wheelock, teaching and supporting
Indians "at his own expense, and on the
voluntary contributions of the charitable," was not
a public officer. The Legislature could not control
his money and that given by others, merely because
Wheelock was using it in an educational charity.
Whence, then, comes "the idea that Dartmouth
College has become a public institution?... Not
from the source" or application of its funds. "Is
it from the act of incorporation?"<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a></p>

<p>Such is the process by which Marshall reaches
his famous definition of the word "corporation":
"A corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible,
and existing only in contemplation of law....
It possesses only those properties which the
charter of its creation confers upon it.... Among
the most important are immortality, and ... individuality....
By these means, a perpetual succession
of individuals are capable of acting for the
promotion of the particular object, like one immortal
being.... But ... it is no more a state instrument
than a natural person exercising the same
powers would be."<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a></p>

<p>This, says Marshall, is obviously true of all private
corporations. "The objects for which a corporation
is created are universally such as the government
wishes to promote." Why should a private charity,
incorporated for the purpose of education, be excluded
from the rules that apply to other corporations?
An individual who volunteers to teach is not
a public officer because of his personal devotion to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
education; how, then, is it that a corporation formed
for precisely the same service "should become a part
of the civil government of the country?" Because
the Government has authorized the corporation "to
take and to hold property in a particular form, and
for particular purposes, has the Government a consequent
right substantially to change that form, or
to vary the purposes to which the property is to
be applied?" Such an idea is without precedent.
Can it be supported by reason?<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

<p>Any corporation for any purpose is created only
because it is "deemed beneficial to the country; and
this benefit constitutes the consideration, and, in
most cases, the sole consideration for the grant." This
is as true of incorporated charities as of any other form
of incorporation. Of consequence, the Government
cannot, subsequently, assume a power over such a
corporation which is "in direct contradiction to its
[the corporate charter's] express stipulations." So
the mere fact "that a charter of incorporation has
been granted" does not justify a Legislature in
changing "the character of the institution," or in
transferring "to the Government any new power
over it."</p>

<p>"The character of civil institutions does not grow
out of their incorporation, but out of the manner in
which they are formed, and the objects for which they
are created. The right to change them is not founded
on their being incorporated, but on their being the
instruments of government, created for its purposes.
The same institutions, created for the same objects,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
though not incorporated, would be public institutions,
and, of course, be controllable by the legislature.
The incorporating act neither gives nor prevents this
control. Neither, in reason, can the incorporating
act change the character of a private eleemosynary
institution."<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a></p>

<p>For whose benefit was the property of Dartmouth
College given to that institution? For the people at
large, as counsel insist? Read the charter. Does it
give the State "any exclusive right to the property
of the college, any exclusive interest in the labors of
the professors?" Does it not rather "merely indicate
a willingness that New Hampshire should enjoy
those advantages which result to all from the establishment
of a seminary of learning in the neighborhood?
On this point we think it impossible to entertain
a serious doubt." For the charter shows that,
while the spread of education and religion was the
object of the founders of the College, the "particular
interests" of the State "never entered into the minds
of the donors, never constituted a motive for their
donation."<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a></p>

<p>It is plain, therefore, that every element of the
problem shows "that Dartmouth College is an
eleemosynary institution, incorporated for the purpose
of perpetuating ... the bounty of the donors,
to the specified objects of that bounty"; that the
Trustees are legally authorized to perpetuate themselves
and that they are "not public officers"; that,
in fine, Dartmouth College is a "seminary of education,
incorporated for the preservation of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
property, and the perpetual application of that property
to the objects of its creation."<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<p>There remains a question most doubtful of "all
that have been discussed." Neither those who have
given money or land to the College, nor students who
have profited by those benefactions, "complain of
the alteration made in its charter, or think themselves
injured by it. The trustees alone complain,
and the trustees have no beneficial interest to be
protected." Can the charter "be such a contract as
the constitution intended to withdraw from the
power of state legislation?"<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></p>

<p>Wheelock and the other philanthropists who had
endowed the College, both before and after the charter
was granted, made their gifts "for something ...
of inestimable value&mdash;... the perpetual application
of the fund to its object, in the mode prescribed
by themselves.... The corporation ... stands
in their place, and distributes their bounty, as they
would themselves have distributed it, had they
been immortal." Also the rights of the students
"collectively" are "to be exercised ... by the corporation."<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<p>The British Parliament is omnipotent. Yet had it
annulled the charter, even immediately after it had
been granted and conveyances made to the corporation
upon the faith of that charter, "so that the
living donors would have witnessed the disappointment
of their hopes, the perfidy of the transaction
would have been universally acknowledged." Nevertheless,
Parliament would have had the power to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
perpetrate such an outrage. "Then, as now, the
donors would have had no interest in the property;
... the students ... no rights to be violated; ... the
trustees ... no private, individual, beneficial interest
in the property confided to their protection." But,
despite the legal power of Parliament to destroy it,
"the contract would at that time have been deemed
sacred by all."</p>

<p>"What has since occurred to strip it of its inviolability?
Circumstances have not changed it. In
reason, in justice, and in law, it is now what it was
in 1769." The donors and Trustees, on the one hand,
and the Crown on the other, were the original parties
to the arrangement stated in the charter, which
was "plainly a contract" between those parties. To
the "rights and obligations" of the Crown under
that contract, "New Hampshire succeeds."<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> Can
such a contract be impaired by a State Legislature?</p>

<p>"It is a contract made on a valuable consideration.</p>

<p>"It is a contract for the security and disposition
of property.</p>

<p>"It is a contract, on the faith of which real and
personal estate has been conveyed to the corporation.</p>

<p>"It is then a contract within the letter of the
constitution, and within its spirit also, unless" the
nature of the trust creates "a particular exception,
taking this case out of the prohibition contained in
the constitution."</p>

<p>It is doubtless true that the "preservation of
rights of this description was not particularly in the
view of the framers of the constitution when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
clause under consideration was introduced into that
instrument," and that legislative interferences with
contractual obligations "of more frequent recurrence,
to which the temptation was stronger, and
of which the mischief was more extensive, constituted
the great motive for imposing this restriction
on the state legislatures.</p>

<p>"But although a particular and a rare case may
not ... induce a rule, yet it must be governed by the
rule, when established, unless some plain and strong
reason for excluding it can be given. It is not enough
to say that this particular case was not in the mind
of the convention when the article was framed, nor
of the American people when it was adopted. It is
necessary to go farther, and to say that, had this
particular case been suggested, the language [of the
contract clause] would have been so varied as to
exclude it, or it would have been made a special
exception."<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a></p>

<p>Can the courts now make such an exception? "On
what safe and intelligible ground can this exception
stand?" Nothing in the language of the Constitution;
no "sentiment delivered by its contemporaneous
expounders ... justify us in making it."</p>

<p>Does "the nature and reason of the case itself ...
sustain a construction of the constitution, not warranted
by its words?" The contract clause was
made a part of the Nation's fundamental law "to
give stability to contracts." That clause in its
"plain import" comprehends Dartmouth's charter.
Does public policy demand a construction which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
will exclude it? The fate of all similar corporations
is involved. "The law of this case is the law of all."<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>
Is it so necessary that Legislatures shall "new-model"
such charters "that the ordinary rules of
construction must be disregarded in order to leave
them exposed to legislative alteration?"</p>

<p>The importance attached by the American people
to corporate charters like that of Dartmouth
College is proved by "the interest which this case
has excited." If the framers of the Constitution
respected science and literature so highly as to give
the National Government exclusive power to protect
inventors and writers by patents and copyrights,
were those statesman "so regardless of contracts
made for the advancement of literature as to
intend to exclude them from provisions made for
the security of ordinary contracts between man
and man?"<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a></p>

<p>No man ever did or will found a college, "believing
at the time that an act of incorporation constitutes
no security for the institution; believing that it is
immediately to be deemed a public institution,
whose funds are to be governed and applied, not by
the will of the donor, but by the will of the legislature.
All such gifts are made in the pleasing, perhaps
delusive hope, that the charity will flow forever in the
channel which the givers have marked out for it."</p>

<p>Since every man finds evidence of this truth
"in his own bosom," can it be imagined that
"the framers of our constitution were strangers"
to the same universal sentiment? Although "feeling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
the necessity ... of giving permanence and security
to contracts," because of the "fluctuating" course
and "repeated interferences" of Legislatures which
resulted in the "most perplexing and injurious embarrassments,"
did the framers of the Constitution
nevertheless deem it "necessary to leave these contracts
subject to those interferences?" Strong, indeed,
must be the motives for making such exceptions.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

<p>Finally, Marshall declares that the "opinion of
the court, after mature deliberation, is, that this is
a contract, the obligation of which cannot be impaired
without violating the Constitution of the
United States."<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a></p>

<p>Do the New Hampshire College Acts impair the
obligations of Dartmouth's charter? That instrument
gave the Trustees "the whole power of governing
the college"; stipulated that the corporation
"should continue forever"; and "that the number
of trustees should forever consist of twelve, and no
more." This contract was made by the Crown, a
power which could have made "no violent alteration
in its essential terms, without impairing its obligation."</p>

<p>The powers and duties of the Crown were, by the
Revolution, "devolved on the people of New Hampshire."
It follows that, since the Crown could not
change the charter of Dartmouth without impairing
the contract, neither can New Hampshire. "All
contracts, and rights, respecting property, remained
unchanged by the revolution."<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>As to whether the New Hampshire College Acts
radically alter the charter of Dartmouth College,
"two opinions cannot be entertained." The State
takes over the government of the institution. "The
will of the state is substituted for the will of the
donors, in every essential operation of the college....
The charter of 1769 exists no longer"&mdash;the College
has been converted into "a machine entirely subservient
to the will of government," instead of the
"will of its founders."<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> Therefore, the New Hampshire
College laws "are repugnant to the constitution
of the United States."<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a></p>

<p>On account of the death of Woodward, who had
been Secretary and Treasurer of the University, and
formerly held the same offices in the College against
whom the College Trustees had brought suit, Webster
moved for judgment <i>nunc pro tunc</i>; and judgment
was immediately entered accordingly.</p>

<p>Not for an instant could Webster restrain the
expression of his joy. Before leaving the court-room
he wrote his brother: "All is safe.... The
opinion was delivered by the Chief Justice. It was
very able and very elaborate; it goes the whole
length, and leaves not an inch of ground for the
University to stand on."<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> He informed President
Brown that "all is safe and certain.... I feel a load
removed from my shoulders much heavier than
they have been accustomed to bear."<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> To Mason,
Webster describes Marshall's manner: "The Chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
Justice's opinion was in his own peculiar way. He
reasoned along from step to step; and, not referring
to the cases [cited], adopted the principles of
them, and worked the whole into a close, connected,
and very able argument."<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

<p>At the same time Hopkinson wrote Brown in a vein
equally exuberant: "Our triumph ... has been complete.
Five judges, only six attending, concur not
only in a decision in our favor, but in placing it upon
principles broad and deep, and which secure corporations
of this description from legislative despotism
and party violence for the future.... I would have an
inscription over the door of your building, 'Founded
by Eleazar Wheelock, Refounded by Daniel Webster.'"<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a>
The high-tempered Pinkney was vocally
indignant. "He talked ... and blustered" ungenerously,
wrote Webster, "because ... the party was in
a fever and he must do something for his fees. As he
could not talk <i>in</i> court, he therefore talked <i>out</i> of
court."<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></p>

<p>As we have seen, Marshall had prepared his opinion
under his trees at Richmond and in the mountains
during the vacation of 1818; and he had barely
time to read it to his associates before the opening
of court at the session when it was delivered. But
he afterward submitted the manuscript to Story,
who made certain changes, although enthusiastically
praising it. "I am much obliged," writes Marshall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
"by the alterations you have made in the Dartmouth
College case &amp; am highly gratified by what
you say respecting it."<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a></p>

<p>Story also delivered an opinion upholding the
charter<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>&mdash;one of his ablest papers. It fairly bristles
with citations of precedents and historical examples.
The whole philosophy of corporations is expounded
with clearness, power, and learning. Apparently
Justice Livingston liked Story's opinion even
more than that of Marshall. Story had sent it to
Livingston, who, when returning the manuscript,
wrote: It "has afforded me more pleasure than can
easily be expressed. It was exactly what I had expected
from you, and hope it will be adopted without
alteration."<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a></p>

<p>At the time of the Dartmouth decision little attention
was paid to it outside of New Hampshire and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
Massachusetts.<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> The people, and even the bar, were
too much occupied with bank troubles, insolvency,
and the swiftly approaching slavery question, to
bother about a small New Hampshire college. The
profound effect of Marshall's opinion was first noted
in the <i>North American Review</i> a year after the Chief
Justice delivered it. "Perhaps no judicial proceedings
in this country ever involved more important
consequences, ... than the case of Dartmouth College."<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></p>

<p>Important, indeed, were the "consequences" of
the Dartmouth decision. Everywhere corporations
were springing up in response to the necessity for
larger and more constant business units and because
of the convenience and profit of such organizations.
Marshall's opinion was a tremendous stimulant to
this natural economic tendency. It reassured investors
in corporate securities and gave confidence
and steadiness to the business world. It is undeniable
and undenied that America could not have been
developed so rapidly and solidly without the power
which the law as announced by Marshall gave to
industrial organization.</p>

<p>One result of his opinion was, for the period, of
even higher value than the encouragement it gave
to private enterprise and the steadiness it brought
to business generally; it aligned on the side of
Nationalism all powerful economic forces operating
through corporate organization. A generation
passed before railway development began in Amer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>ica;
but Marshall lived to see the first stage of
the evolution of that mighty element in American
commercial, industrial, and social life; and all of
that force, except the part of it which was directly
connected with and under the immediate influence
of the slave power, was aggressively and most
effectively Nationalist.</p>

<p>That this came to be the fact was due to Marshall's
Dartmouth opinion more than to any other
single cause. The same was true of other industrial
corporate organizations. John Fiske does not greatly
exaggerate in his assertion that the law as to corporate
franchises declared by Marshall, in subjecting
to the National Constitution every charter granted
by a State "went farther, perhaps, than any other
in our history toward limiting State sovereignty and
extending the Federal jurisdiction."<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></p>

<p>Sir Henry Sumner Maine has some ground for
his rather dogmatic statement that the principle of
Marshall's opinion "is the basis of credit of many
of the great American Railway Incorporations," and
"has ... secured full play to the economical forces
by which the achievement of cultivating the soil of
the North American Continent has been performed."
Marshall's statesmanship is, asserts Maine, "the
bulwark of American individualism against democratic
impatience and Socialistic fantasy."<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> Such
views of the Dartmouth decision are remarkably
similar to those which Story himself expressed soon
after it was rendered. Writing to Chancellor Kent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
Story says: "Unless I am very much mistaken the
principles on which that decision rests will be found
to apply with an extensive reach to all the great
concerns of the people, and will check any undue
encroachments upon civil rights, which the passions
or the popular doctrines of the day may stimulate
our State Legislatures to adopt."<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a></p>

<p>The court's decision, however, made corporate
franchises infinitely more valuable and strengthened
the motives for procuring them, even by corruption.
In this wise tremendous frauds have been perpetrated
upon negligent, careless, and indifferent publics;
and "enormous and threatening powers," selfish
and non-public in their purposes and methods, have
been created.<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> But Marshall's opinion put the public
on its guard. Almost immediately the States enacted
laws reserving to the Legislature the right to alter or
repeal corporate charters; and the constitutions of
several States now include this limitation on corporate
franchises. Yet these reservations did not, as
a practical matter, nullify or overthrow Marshall's
philosophy of the sacredness of contracts.</p>

<p>Within the last half-century the tendency has been
strongly away from the doctrine of the Dartmouth
decision, and this tendency has steadily become more
powerful. The necessity of modifying and even abrogating
legislative grants, more freely than is secured
by the reservation to do so contained in State constitutions
and corporate charters, has further restricted
the Dartmouth decision. It is this necessity that has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
produced the rapid development of "that well-known
but undefined power called the police power,"<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> under
which laws may be passed and executed, in disregard
of what Marshall would have called contracts, provided
such laws are necessary for the protection
or preservation of life, health, property, morals, or
order. The modern doctrine is that "the Legislature
cannot, by any contract, divest itself of the power to
provide for these objects.... They are to be attained
and provided for by such appropriate means as the
legislative discretion may devise. That discretion
can no more be bargained away than the power
itself."<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a></p>

<p>Aside from the stability which this pronouncement
of the Chief Justice gave to commercial transactions
in general, and the confidence it inspired
throughout the business world, the largest permanent
benefit of it to the American people was to teach
them that faith once plighted, whether in private
contracts or public grants, must not and cannot be
broken by State legislation; that, by the fundamental
law which they themselves established for
their own government, they as political entities
are forbidden to break their contracts by enacting
statutes, just as, by the very spirit of the law, private
persons are forbidden to break their contracts.
If it be said that their representatives may betray
the people, the plain answer is that the people must
learn to elect honest agents.</p>

<p>For exactly a century Marshall's Dartmouth opin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>ion
has been assailed and the Supreme Court itself
has often found ways to avoid its conclusions. But
the theory of the Chief Justice has shown amazing
vitality. Sixty years after Marshall delivered it, Chief
Justice Waite declared that the principles it announced
are so "imbedded in the jurisprudence of
the United States as to make them to all intents
and purposes a part of the Constitution itself."<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>
Thirty-one years after Marshall died, Justice Davis
avowed that "a departure from it [Marshall's doctrine]
<i>now</i> would involve dangers to society that
cannot be foreseen, would shock the sense of justice
of the country, unhinge its business interests, and
weaken, if not destroy, that respect which has always
been felt for the judicial department of the
Government."<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> As late as 1895, Justice Brown asserted
that it has "become firmly established as a
canon of American jurisprudence."<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a></p>

<p>It was a principle which Marshall introduced into
American Constitutional law, and, fortunately for
the country, that principle still stands; but to-day
the courts, when construing a law said to impair the
obligation of contracts, most properly require that
it be established that the unmistakable purpose of
the Legislature is to make an actual contract for a
sufficient consideration.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>
<p>It is highly probable that in the present state
of the country's development, the Supreme Court
would not decide that the contract clause so
broadly protects corporate franchises as Marshall
held a century ago. In considering the Dartmouth
decision, however, the state of things existing when
it was rendered must be taken into account. It is
certain that Marshall was right in his interpretation
of corporation law as it existed in 1819; right in the
practical result of his opinion in that particular case;
and, above all, right in the purpose and effect of that
opinion on the condition and tendency of the country
at the perilous time it was delivered.</p>

them answer their end ... is most absurd.... Yet our lawyers and priests
generally inculcate this doctrine; and suppose that preceding generations ... had
a right to impose laws on us, unalterable by ourselves; ...

Webster's management of the case is that, since the College was
founded for the education of Indians and none of them had attended
for a long time, Webster advised President Brown to procure two or
three. Brown got a number from Canada and brought them to the
river beyond which were the College buildings. While the party were
rowing across, the young Indians, seeing the walls and fearing that
they were to be put in prison, gave war whoops, sprang into the stream,
swam to shore and fled. So Webster had to go on without them. (Harvey:

is not the slightest evidence to support this absurd tale. (Letters to

Dartmouth case&mdash;a pretty sure sign that it attracted little attention
in Washington. Contrast Story's silence as to this argument with his
vivid description of that of M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland (<i>infra</i>, chap. <span class="smcap">vi</span>).
Goodrich attributes the scant attendance to the fact that the court
sat "in a mean apartment of moderate size"; but that circumstance
did not keep women as well as men from thronging the room when a
notable case was to be heard or a celebrated lawyer was to speak. (See
description of the argument of the case of the Nereid, <i>supra</i>, 133-34.)</p></div>

It is possible that Hopkinson was chosen instead, upon the advice of
Webster, who kept himself well informed of the estimate placed by
Marshall and the Associate Justices on lawyers who appeared before
them. Marshall liked and admired Hopkinson, had been his personal
friend for years, and often wrote him. When Peters died in 1828,
Marshall secured the appointment of Hopkinson in his place. (Marshall

the influence of "practical politics" on the State officials and the
Trustees of the University. The Board voted December 31, 1817, "to
take charge of the case." Benjamin Hale, one of the new Trustees, was
commissioned to secure other counsel if Holmes did not accept. Apparently
Woodward was Holmes's champion: "I have thought him
extremely ready ... [a] good lawyer, inferior to D. W. only in point of
oratory." (Woodward to Hall, Jan. 18, 1818, Lord, 139-40.) Hardly
had Hale reached Washington than he wrote Woodward: "Were you
sensible of the low ebb of Mr. Holmes' reputation here, you would ...
be unwilling to trust the cause with him." (Hale to Woodward, Feb.

A year later, after the case had been decided, when the question of
publishing Farrar's <i>Report</i> of all the arguments and opinions in the
Dartmouth College case was under consideration, Webster wrote
Mason: "My own interest would be promoted by <i>preventing</i> the Book.
I shall strut well enough in the Washington Report, &amp; if the 'Book'
should not be published, the world would not know where I borrowed
my plumes&mdash;But I am still inclined to have the Book&mdash;One reason
is, that you &amp; Judge Smith may have the credit which belongs to you."

(Italics the author's.) In fact three such suits were brought early
in 1818 on the ground of diverse citizenship. (Shirley, 2-3.) Any one
of them would have enabled the Supreme Court to have passed on
the "general principles" of contract and government. These cases,
had they arrived on time, would have afforded Story his almost frantically
desired opportunity to declare that legislation violative of contracts
was against "natural right"&mdash;an opinion he fervently desired
to give. But the wiser Marshall saw in the case, as presented to the
Supreme Court on the contract guarantee of the Constitution, the
occasion to declare, in effect, that these same fundamental principles
are embraced in the contract clause of the written Constitution of the
American Nation.</p></div>

justice." (Webster to Brown, March 13, 1818, <i>Priv. Corres.</i>: Webster,

</p><p>
Murdock mentions Pickering as one of those who believed the
rumors about Story. This explains much. The soured old Federalist
was an incessant gossip and an indefatigable purveyor of rumors concerning
any one he did not like, provided the reports were bad enough
for him to repeat. He himself would, with great facility, apply the
black, if the canvas were capable of receiving it; and he could not forget
that Story, when a young man, had been a Republican.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_733_733" id="Footnote_733_733"></a><a href="#FNanchor_733_733"><span class="label">[733]</span></a> This is principally the work of John M. Shirley in his book <i>Dartmouth
College Causes and the Supreme Court of the United States</i>. The
volume is crammed with the results of extensive research, strange
conglomeration of facts, suppositions, inferences, and insinuations,
so inextricably mingled that it is with the utmost difficulty that the
painstaking student can find his way.
</p><p>
Shirley leaves the impression that Justices Johnson and Livingston
were improperly worked upon because they consulted Chancellor
Kent. Yet the only ground for this is that Judge Marsh sent Webster's
argument to Kent, who was Marsh's intimate friend; and
that the Reverend Francis Brown, President of Dartmouth, went
to see Kent, reported that his opinion was favorable to the College,
and that the effect of this would be good upon Johnson and Livingston.
</p><p>
From the mere rumor, wholly without justification, that Story was
at first against the College&mdash;indeed, had drawn the College Acts (for
so the rumor grew, as rumors always grow)&mdash;Shirley would have us
believe, without any evidence whatever, that some improper influence
was exerted over Story.
</p><p>
Because Webster said that there was something "left out" of the
report of his argument, Shirley declares that for a whole hour Webster
spoke as a Federalist partisan in order to influence Marshall. (Shirley,
237.) But such an attempt would have been resented by every Republican
member of the court and, most of all, by Marshall himself. Moreover,
Marshall needed no such persuasion, nor, indeed, persuasion of
any kind. His former opinions showed where he stood; so did the
views which he had openly and constantly avowed since he was a
member of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1783. The something
"left out" of Webster's reported argument was, of course, his extemporaneous
and emotional peroration described by Goodrich.
</p><p>
These are only a very few instances of Shirley's assumptions. Yet,
because of the mass of data his book contains, and because of the impossibility
of getting out of them a connected narrative without the
most laborious and time-consuming examination, together with the
atmosphere of wrongdoing with which Shirley manages to surround
the harried reader, his volume has had a strong and erroneous effect
upon general opinion.</p></div>

by the authority of adjudged cases. As one of the public, I thank you
for establishing a doctrine affecting so many valuable rights and interests,

<h3>VITALIZING THE CONSTITUTION</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The crisis is one which portends destruction to the liberties of the American
people. (Spencer Roane.)</p>

<p>The constitutional government of this republican empire cannot be practically
enforced but by a fair and liberal interpretation of its powers.
(William Pinkney.)</p>

<p>The Judiciary of the United States is the subtle corps of sappers and miners
constantly working under ground to undermine the foundations of our confederated
fabric. (Jefferson.)</p>

<p>The government of the Union is emphatically and truly a government of the
people. In form and substance it emanates from them. Its powers are granted
by them, and are to be exercised directly on them and for their benefit.
(Marshall.)</p>
</div>


<p>Although it was the third of the great causes to
be decided by the Supreme Court in the memorable
year, 1819, M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland was the first in
importance and in the place it holds in the development
of the American Constitution. Furthermore,
in his opinion in this case John Marshall rose to the
loftiest heights of judicial statesmanship. If his fame
rested solely on this one effort, it would be secure.</p>

<p>To comprehend the full import of Marshall's opinion
in this case, the reader must consider the state of
the country as described in the fourth chapter of this
volume. While none of his expositions of our fundamental
law, delivered in the critical epoch from 1819
to 1824, can be entirely understood without knowledge
of the National conditions that produced them,
this fact must be especially borne in mind when reviewing
the case of M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland.</p>

<p>Like most of the controversies in which Marshall's
Constitutional opinions were pronounced, M'Culloch
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
<i>vs.</i> Maryland came before the Supreme Court on
an agreed case. The facts were that Congress had
authorized the incorporation of the second Bank of
the United States; that this institution had instituted
a branch at Baltimore; that the Legislature of
Maryland had passed an act requiring all banks,
established "without authority from the state," to
issue notes only on stamped paper and only of certain
denominations, or, in lieu of these requirements,
only upon the payment of an annual tax of fifteen
thousand dollars; that, in violation of this law, the
Baltimore branch of the National Bank continued
to issue its notes on unstamped paper without paying
the tax; and that on May 8, 1818, John James,
"Treasurer of the Western Shore," had sued James
William M'Culloch, the cashier of the Baltimore
branch, for the recovery of the penalties prescribed
by the Maryland statute.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a></p>

<p>The immediate question was whether the Maryland
law was Constitutional; but the basic issue
was the supremacy of the National Government as
against the dominance of State Governments. Indeed,
the decision of this case involved the very
existence of the Constitution as an "ordinance of
Nationality," as Marshall so accurately termed it.</p>

<p>At no time in this notable session of the Supreme
Court was the basement room, where its sittings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
were now again held, so thronged with auditors as
it was when the argument in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland
took place. "We have had a crowded audience
of ladies and gentlemen," writes Story toward the
close of the nine days of discussion. "The hall was
full almost to suffocation, and many went away
for want of room."<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a></p>

<p>Webster opened the case for the Bank. His masterful
argument in the Dartmouth College case the
year before had established his reputation as a great
Constitutional lawyer as well as an orator of the first
class. He was attired in the height of fashion, tight
breeches, blue cloth coat, cut away squarely at the
waist, and adorned with large brass buttons, waist-coat
exposing a broad expanse of ruffled shirt with
high soft collar surrounded by an elaborate black
stock.<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a></p>

<p>The senior counsel for the Bank was William Pinkney.
He was dressed with his accustomed foppish
elegance, and, as usual, was nervous and impatient.
Notwithstanding his eccentricities, he was Webster's
equal, if not his superior, except in physical presence
and the gift of political management. With Webster
and Pinkney was William Wirt, then Attorney-General
of the United States, who had arrived at the
fullness of his powers.</p>

<p>Maryland was represented by Luther Martin, still
Attorney-General for that State, then seventy-five
years old, but a strong lawyer despite his half-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>century,
at least, of excessive drinking. By his side
was Joseph Hopkinson of Philadelphia, now fifty
years of age, one of the most learned men at the
American bar. With Martin and Hopkinson was
Walter Jones of Washington, who appears to have
been a legal genius, his fame obliterated by devotion
to his profession and unaided by any public service,
which so greatly helps to give permanency to the
lawyer's reputation. All told, the counsel for both
sides in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland were the most eminent
and distinguished in the Republic.</p>

<p>Webster said in opening that Hamilton had "exhausted"
the arguments for the power of Congress
to charter a bank and that Hamilton's principles had
long been acted upon. After thirty years of acquiescence
it was too late to deny that the National Legislature
could establish a bank.<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> With meticulous care
Webster went over Hamilton's reasoning to prove
that Congress can "pass all laws 'necessary and
proper' to carry into execution powers conferred
on it."<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a></p>

<p>Assuming the law which established the Bank to
be Constitutional, could Maryland tax a branch of
that Bank? If the State could tax the Bank at all,
she could put it out of existence, since a "power to
tax involves ... a power to destroy"<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a>&mdash;words that
Marshall, in delivering his opinion, repeated as his
own. The truth was, said Webster, that, in taxing
the Baltimore branch of the National Bank, Maryland
taxed the National Government itself.<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a></p>

<p>Joseph Hopkinson, as usual, made a superb argu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>ment&mdash;a
performance all the more admirable as an
intellectual feat in that, as an advocate for Maryland,
his convictions were opposed to his reasoning.<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a>
Walter Jones was as thorough as he was lively, but
he did little more than to reinforce the well-nigh perfect
argument of Hopkinson.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> On the same side the
address of Luther Martin deserves notice as the last
worthy of remark which that great lawyer ever made.
Old as he was, and wasted as were his astonishing
powers, his argument was not much inferior to those
of Webster, Hopkinson, and Pinkney. Martin showed
by historical evidence that the power now claimed
for Congress was suspected by the opponents of
the Constitution, but denied by its supporters and
called "a dream of distempered jealousy." So came
the Tenth Amendment; yet, said Martin, now,
"we are asked to engraft upon it [the Constitution]
powers ... which were disclaimed by them [the advocates
of the Constitution], and which, if they had
been fairly avowed at the time, would have prevented
its adoption."<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></p>

<p>Could powers of Congress be inferred as a necessary
means to the desired end? Why, then, did the
Constitution <i>expressly</i> confer powers which, of necessity,
must be implied? For instance, the power
to declare war surely implied the power to raise
armies; and yet that very power was granted in specific
terms. But the power to create corporations
"is not expressly delegated, either as an end or a
means of national government."<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>When Martin finished, William Pinkney, whom
Marshall declared to be "the greatest man he had
ever seen in a Court of justice,"<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> rose to make what
proved to be the last but one of the great arguments
of that unrivaled leader of the American bar of his
period. To reproduce his address is to set out in
advance the opinion of John Marshall stripped of
Pinkney's rhetoric which, in that day, was deemed
to be the perfection of eloquence.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>

<p>For three days Pinkney spoke. Few arguments
ever made in the Supreme Court affected so profoundly
the members of that tribunal. Story describes
the argument thus: "Mr. Pinkney rose
on Monday to conclude the argument; he spoke
all that day and yesterday, and will probably conclude
to-day. I never, in my whole life, heard a
greater speech; it was worth a journey from Salem
to hear it; his elocution was excessively vehement, but
his eloquence was overwhelming. His language, his
style, his figures, his arguments, were most brilliant
and sparkling. He spoke like a great statesman and
patriot, and a sound constitutional lawyer. All the
cobwebs of sophistry and metaphysics about State
rights and State sovereignty he brushed away with
a mighty besom."<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, all the lawyers in this memorable contest
appear to have surpassed their previous efforts at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the bar. Marshall, in his opinion, pays this tribute
to all their addresses: "Both in maintaining the affirmative
and the negative, a splendor of eloquence,
and strength of argument seldom, if ever, surpassed,
have been displayed."<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>

<p>After he had spoken, Webster, who at that moment
was intent on the decision of the Dartmouth College
case,<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> became impatient. "Our Bank argument goes
on&mdash;&amp; threatens to be long," he writes Jeremiah
Mason.<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> Four days later, while Martin was still
talking, Webster informs Jeremiah Smith: "We are
not yet thro. the Bank question. Martin has been
<i>talking 3 ds</i>. Pinkney replies tomorrow &amp; that
finishes&mdash;I set out for home next day."<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> The arguments
in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland occupied nine
days.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a></p>

<p>Four days before the Bank argument opened in
the Supreme Court, the House took up the resolution
offered by James Johnson of Virginia to repeal
the Bank's charter.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> The debate over this proposal
continued until February 25, the third day of the
argument in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland. How, asked
Johnson, had the Bank fulfilled expectations and
promises?  "What ... is our condition? Surrounded
by one universal gloom. We are met by the tears
of the widow and the orphan."<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> Madison has "cast
a shade" on his reputation by signing the Bank Bill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>&mdash;that
"act of usurpation." Under the common law
the charter "is forfeited."<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a></p>

<p>The Bank is a "mighty corporation," created "to
overawe ... the local institutions, that had dealt themselves
almost out of breath in supporting the Government
in times of peril and adversity." The financial
part of the Virginia Republican Party organization
thus spoke through James Pindall of that State.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></p>

<p>William Lowndes of South Carolina brilliantly
defended the Bank, but admitted that its "early
operation" had been "injudicious."<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> John Tyler of
Virginia assailed the Bank with notable force. "This
charter has been violated," he said; "if subjected
to investigation before a court of justice, it will be declared
null and void."<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> David Walker of Kentucky
declared that the Bank "is an engine of favoritism&mdash;of
stock jobbing"&mdash;a machine for "binding in
adamantine chains the blessed, innocent lambs of
America to accursed, corrupt European tigers."<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>
In spite of all this eloquence, Johnson's resolution
was defeated, and the fate of the Bank left in the
hands of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>On March 6, 1819, before a few spectators, mostly
lawyers with business before the court, Marshall
read his opinion. It is the misfortune of the biographer
that only an abstract can be given of this
epochal state paper&mdash;among the very first of the
greatest judicial utterances of all time.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> It was de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>livered
only three days after Pinkney concluded his
superb address.</p>

<p>Since it is one of the longest of Marshall's opinions
and, by general agreement, is considered to be his
ablest and most carefully prepared exposition of the
Constitution, it seems not unlikely that much of it
had been written before the argument. The court
was very busy every day of the session and there
was little, if any, time for Marshall to write this
elaborate document. The suit against M'Culloch
had been brought nearly a year before the Supreme
Court convened; Marshall undoubtedly learned of
it through the newspapers; he was intimately familiar
with the basic issue presented by the litigation;
and he had ample time to formulate and even to
write out his views before the ensuing session of the
court. He had, in the opinions of Hamilton and Jefferson,<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>
the reasoning on both sides of this fundamental
controversy. It appears to be reasonably
probable that at least the framework of the opinion
in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland was prepared by Marshall
when in Richmond during the summer, autumn,
and winter of 1818-19.</p>

<p>The opening words of Marshall are majestic: "A
sovereign state denies the obligation of a law ... of
the Union.... The constitution of our country, in its
most ... vital parts, is to be considered; the conflicting
powers of the government of the Union and of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
members, ... are to be discussed; and an opinion given,
which may essentially influence the great operations
of the government."<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> He cannot "approach such
a question without a deep sense of ... the awful responsibility
involved in its decision. But it must
be decided peacefully, or remain a source of hostile
legislation, perhaps of <i>hostility of a still more serious
nature</i>."<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> In these solemn words the Chief Justice
reveals the fateful issue which M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland
foreboded.</p>

<p>That Congress has power to charter a bank is
not "an open question.... The principle ... was introduced
at a very early period of our history, has
been recognized by many successive legislatures,
and has been acted upon by the judicial department
... as a law of undoubted obligation.... An exposition
of the constitution, deliberately established by
legislative acts, on the faith of which an immense
property has been advanced, ought not to be lightly
disregarded."</p>

<p>The first Congress passed the act to incorporate a
National bank. The whole subject was at the time
debated exhaustively. "The bill for incorporating
the bank of the United States did not steal upon an
unsuspecting legislature, &amp; pass unobserved," says
Marshall. Moreover, it had been carefully examined
with "persevering talent" in Washington's Cabinet.
When that act expired, "a short experience of the embarrassments"
suffered by the country "induced the
passage of the present law." He must be intrepid,
indeed, who asserts that "a measure adopted under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
these circumstances was a bold and plain usurpation,
to which the constitution gave no countenance."<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></p>

<p>But Marshall examines the question as though it
were "entirely new"; and gives an historical account
of the Constitution which, for clearness and brevity,
never has been surpassed.<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> Thus he proves that
"the government proceeds directly from the people;
... their act was final. It required not the affirmance,
and could not be negatived, by the state governments.
The constitution when thus adopted ...
bound the state sovereignties." The States could
and did establish "a league, such as was the confed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>eration....
But when, 'in order to form a more perfect
union,' it was deemed necessary to change this
alliance into an effective government, ... acting directly
on the people," it was the people themselves
who acted and established a fundamental law for
their government.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></p>

<p>The Government of the American Nation is, then,
"emphatically, and truly, a government of the
people. In form and in substance it emanates from
them. Its powers are granted by them, and are to be
exercised directly on them, and for their benefit"<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a>&mdash;a
statement, the grandeur of which was to be enhanced
forty-four years later, when, standing on the
battle-field of Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said
that "a government of the people, by the people, for
the people, shall not perish from the earth."<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a></p>

<p>To be sure, the States, as well as the Nation, have
certain powers, and therefore "the supremacy of
their respective laws, when they are in opposition,
must be settled." Marshall proceeds to settle that
basic question. The National Government, he begins,
"is supreme within its sphere of action. This would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
seem to result necessarily from its nature." For "it
is the government of all; its powers are delegated by
all; it represents all, and acts for all. Though any
one state may be willing to control its operations,
no state is willing to allow others to control them.
The nation, on those subjects on which it can act,
must necessarily bind its component parts." Plain
as this truth is, the people have not left the demonstration
of it to "mere reason"&mdash;for they have, "in
express terms, decided it by saying" that the Constitution,
and the laws of the United States which
shall be made in pursuance thereof, "shall be the supreme
law of the land," and by requiring all State
officers and legislators to "take the oath of fidelity
to it."<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a></p>

<p>The fact that the powers of the National Government
enumerated in the Constitution do not include
that of creating corporations does not prevent Congress
from doing so. "There is no phrase in the instrument
which, like the articles of confederation,
<i>excludes</i> incidental or implied powers; and which requires
that everything granted shall be expressly
and minutely described.... A constitution, to contain
an accurate detail of all the subdivisions of
which its great powers will admit, and of all the
means by which they may be carried into execution,
would partake of a prolixity of a legal code, and
could scarcely be embraced by the human mind.
It would probably never be understood by the
public."</p>

<p>The very "nature" of a constitution, "therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
requires, that only its great outlines should be
marked, its important objects designated, and the
minor ingredients which compose those <i>objects be
deduced from the nature of the objects themselves</i>." In
deciding such questions "we must never forget,"
reiterates Marshall, "that it is a <i>constitution</i> we are
expounding."<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a></p>

<p>This being true, the power of Congress to establish
a bank is undeniable&mdash;it flows from "the great
powers to lay and collect taxes; to borrow money; to
regulate commerce; to declare and conduct a war;
and to raise and support armies and navies." Consider,
he continues, the scope of the duties of the National
Government: "The sword and the purse, all
the external relations, and no inconsiderable portion
of the industry of the nation, are entrusted to its
government.... A government, entrusted with such
ample powers, on the due execution of which the
happiness and prosperity of the nation so vitally depends,
must also be entrusted with ample means for
their execution. The power being given, it is the
interest of the nation to facilitate its execution. It
can never be their interest, and cannot be presumed
to have been their intention, to clog and embarrass
its execution by withholding the most appropriate
means."<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a></p>

<p>At this point Marshall's language becomes as
exalted as that of the prophets: "Throughout this
vast republic, from the St. Croix to the Gulf of
Mexico, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, revenue
is to be collected and expended, armies are to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
marched and supported. The exigencies of the
nation may require that the treasure raised in the
north should be transported to the south, that
raised in the east conveyed to the west, or that this
order should be reversed." Here Marshall the
soldier is speaking. There is in his words the blast
of the bugle of Valley Forge. Indeed, the pen with
which Marshall wrote M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland was
fashioned in the army of the Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>

<p>The Chief Justice continues: "Is that construction
of the constitution to be preferred which would
render these operations difficult, hazardous, and expensive?"
Did the framers of the Constitution "when
granting these powers for the public good" intend
to impede "their exercise by withholding a choice
of means?" No! The Constitution "does not profess
to enumerate the means by which the powers
it confers may be executed; nor does it prohibit
the creation of a corporation, if the existence of
such a being be essential to the beneficial exercise
of those powers."<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a></p>

<p>Resorting to his favorite method in argument,
that of repetition, Marshall again asserts that the
fact that "the power of creating a corporation is one
appertaining to sovereignty and is not expressly conferred
on Congress," does not take that power from
Congress. If it does, Congress, by the same reasoning,
would be denied the power to pass most laws;
since "all legislative powers appertain to sovereignty."
They who say that Congress may not
select "any appropriate means" to carry out its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
admitted powers, "take upon themselves the burden
of establishing that exception."<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a></p>

<p>The establishment of the National Bank was a
means to an end; the power to incorporate it is
"as incidental" to the great, substantive, and independent
powers expressly conferred on Congress
as that of making war, levying taxes, or regulating
commerce.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> This is not only the plain conclusion
of reason, but the clear language of the Constitution
itself as expressed in the "necessary and proper"
clause<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> of that instrument. Marshall treats with
something like contempt the argument that this
clause does not mean what it says, but is "really
restrictive of the general right, which might otherwise
be implied, of selecting means for executing
the enumerated powers"&mdash;a denial, in short, that,
without this clause, Congress is authorized to make
laws.<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> After conferring on Congress all legislative
power, "after allowing each house to prescribe its
own course of proceeding, after describing the manner
in which a bill should become a law, would it
have entered into the mind ... of the convention
that an express power to make laws was necessary
to enable the legislature to make them?"<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a></p>

<p>In answering the old Jeffersonian argument that,<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a>
under the "necessary and proper" clause, Congress
can adopt only those means absolutely "necessary"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
to the execution of express powers, Marshall devotes
an amount of space which now seems extravagant.
But in 1819 the question was unsettled
and acute; indeed, the Republicans had again made
it a political issue. The Chief Justice repeats the
arguments made by Hamilton in his opinion to
Washington on the first Bank Bill.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a></p>

<p>Some words have various shades of meaning, of
which courts must select that justified by "common
usage." "The word 'necessary' is of this description....
It admits of all degrees of comparison....
A thing may be necessary, very necessary, absolutely
or indispensably necessary." For instance,
the Constitution itself prohibits a State from "laying
'imposts or duties on imports or exports, except
what may be <i>absolutely</i> necessary for executing its
inspection laws'"; whereas it authorizes Congress
to "'make all laws which shall be necessary and
proper'" for the execution of powers expressly
conferred.<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a></p>

<p>Did the framers of the Constitution intend to forbid
Congress to employ "<i>any</i>" means "which might
be appropriate, and which were conducive to the
end"? Most assuredly not! "The subject is the
execution of those great powers on which the welfare
of a nation essentially depends." The "necessary
and proper" clause is found "in a constitution intended
to endure for ages to come, and, consequently,
to be adapted to the various crises of human
affairs.... To have declared that the best means
shall not be used, but those alone without which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
the power given would be nugatory, would have
been to deprive the legislature of the capacity to
avail itself of experience, to exercise its reason, and
to accommodate its legislation to circumstances."<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a></p>

<p>The contrary conclusion is tinged with "insanity."
Whence comes the power of Congress to
prescribe punishment for violations of National
laws? No such general power is expressly given by
the Constitution. Yet nobody denies that Congress
has this general power, although "it is expressly
given in some cases," such as counterfeiting, piracy,
and "offenses against the law of nations." Nevertheless,
the specific authorization to provide for the
punishment of these crimes does not prevent Congress
from doing the same as to crimes not specified.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a></p>

<p>Now comes an example of Marshall's reasoning
when at his best&mdash;and briefest.</p>

<p>"Take, for example, the power 'to establish post-offices
and post-roads.' This power is executed by
the single act of making the establishment. But,
from this has been inferred the power and duty of
carrying the mail along the post-road, from one
post-office to another. And, from this implied
power, has again been inferred the right to punish
those who steal letters from the post-office, or rob
the mail. It may be said, with some plausibility,
that the right to carry the mail, and to punish those
who rob it, is not indispensably necessary to the
establishment of a post-office and post-road. This
right is indeed essential to the beneficial exercise of
the power, but not indispensably necessary to its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
existence. So, of the punishment of the crimes of
stealing or falsifying a record or process of a court
of the United States, or of perjury in such court.
To punish these offenses is certainly conducive to
the due administration of justice. But courts may
exist, and may decide the causes brought before
them, though such crimes escape punishment.</p>

<p>"The baneful influence of this narrow construction
on all the operations of the government, and
the absolute impracticability of maintaining it
without rendering the government incompetent to
its great objects, might be illustrated by numerous
examples drawn from the constitution, and from
our laws. The good sense of the public has pronounced,
without hesitation, that the power of
punishment appertains to sovereignty, and may be
exercised whenever the sovereign has a right to act,
as incidental to his constitutional powers. It is a
means for carrying into execution all sovereign
powers, and may be used, although not indispensably
necessary. It is a right incidental to the power,
and conducive to its beneficial exercise."<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a></p>

<p>To attempt to prove that Congress <i>might</i> execute
its powers without the use of other means than
those absolutely necessary would be "to waste time
and argument," and "not much less idle than to
hold a lighted taper to the sun." It is futile to speculate
upon imaginary reasons for the "necessary and
proper" clause, since its purpose is obvious. It "is
placed among the powers of Congress, not among
the limitations on those powers. Its terms purport<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
to enlarge, not to diminish the powers vested in the
government.... If no other motive for its insertion
can be suggested, a sufficient one is found in the
desire to remove all doubts respecting the right to
legislate on the vast mass of incidental powers which
must be involved in the constitution, if that instrument
be not a splendid bauble."<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

<p>Marshall thus reaches the conclusion that Congress
may "perform the high duties assigned to it,
in the manner most beneficial to the people." Then
comes that celebrated passage&mdash;one of the most
famous ever delivered by a jurist: "Let the end be
legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution,
and all means which are appropriate, which are
plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited,
but consist with the letter and spirit of the
constitution, are constitutional."<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a></p>

<p>Further on the Chief Justice restates this fundamental
principle, without which the Constitution
would be a lifeless thing: "Where the law is not
prohibited, and is really calculated to effect any of
the objects entrusted to the government, to undertake
here to inquire into the degree of its necessity,
would be to pass the line which circumscribes
the judicial department, and to tread on legislative
ground. The court disclaims all pretensions to such
a power."<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a></p>

<p>The fact that there were State banks with whose
business the National Bank might interfere, had
nothing to do with the question of the power
of Congress to establish the latter. The National<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
Government does not depend on State Governments
"for the execution of the great powers assigned to it.
Its means are adequate to its ends." It can choose a
National bank rather than State banks as an agency
for the transaction of its business; "and Congress
alone can make the election."</p>

<p>It is, then, "the unanimous and decided opinion"
of the court that the Bank Act is Constitutional. So
is the establishment of the branches of the parent
bank. Can States tax these branches, as Maryland
has tried to do? Of course the power of taxation "is
retained by the states," and "is not abridged by
the grant of a similar power to the government of
the Union." These are "truths which have never
been denied."</p>

<p>With sublime audacity Marshall then declares
that "such is the paramount character of the constitution
that its capacity to withdraw any subject
from the action of even this power, is admitted."<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a>
This assertion fairly overwhelms the student, since
the States then attempting to tax out of existence
the branches of the National Bank did not admit,
but emphatically denied, that the National Government
could withdraw from State taxation any taxable
subject whatever, except that which the Constitution
itself specifically withdraws.</p>

<p>"The States," argues Marshall, "are expressly
forbidden" to tax imports and exports. This being
so, "the same paramount character would seem to
restrain, as it certainly may restrain, a state from
such other exercise of this [taxing] power, as is in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
its nature incompatible with, and repugnant to, the
constitutional laws of the Union. A law, absolutely
repugnant to another, as entirely repeals that other
as if express terms of repeal were used."</p>

<p>In this fashion Marshall holds, in effect, that
Congress can restrain the States from taxing certain
subjects not mentioned in the Constitution as fully
as though those subjects were expressly named.</p>

<p>It is on this ground that the National Bank claims
exemption "from the power of a state to tax its
operations." Marshall concedes that "there is no
express provision [in the Constitution] for the case,
but the claim has been sustained on a principle
which so entirely pervades the constitution, is so
intermixed with the materials which compose it, so
interwoven with its web, so blended with its texture,
as to be incapable of being separated from it
without rendering it into shreds."<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a></p>

<p>This was, indeed, going far&mdash;the powers of Congress
placed on "a principle" rather than on the
language of the Constitution. When we consider
the period in which this opinion was given to the
country, we can understand&mdash;though only vaguely
at this distance of time&mdash;the daring of John
Marshall. Yet he realizes the extreme radicalism
of the theory of Constitutional interpretation he is
thus advancing, and explains it with scrupulous care.</p>

<p>"This great principle is that the constitution and
the laws made in pursuance thereof are supreme;
that they control the constitution and laws of the
respective states, and cannot be controlled by them.
From this, which may be almost termed an axiom,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
other propositions are deduced as corollaries, on the
truth or error of which ... the cause is supposed to
depend."<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a></p>

<p>That "cause" was not so much the one on the
docket of the Supreme Court, entitled M'Culloch
<i>vs.</i> Maryland, as it was that standing on the docket
of fate entitled Nationalism <i>vs</i>. Localism. And,
although Marshall did not actually address them,
everybody knew that he was speaking to the disunionists
who were increasing in numbers and boldness.
Everybody knew, also, that the Chief Justice
was, in particular, replying to the challenge of the
Virginia Republican organization as given through
the Court of Appeals of that State.<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a></p>

<p>The corollaries which Marshall deduced from the
principle of National supremacy were: "1st. That a
power to create implies a power to preserve. 2d.
That a power to destroy, if wielded by a different
hand, is hostile to, and incompatible with these powers
to create and to preserve. 3d. That where this
repugnancy exists, that authority which is supreme
must control, not yield to that over which it is
supreme."<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a></p>

<p>It is "too obvious to be denied," continues Marshall
that, if permitted to exercise the power, the
States can tax the Bank "so as to destroy it." The
power of taxation is admittedly "sovereign"; but
the taxing power of the States "is subordinate to,
and may be controlled by the constitution of the
United States. How far it has been controlled by that
instrument must be a question of construction. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
making this construction, no principle not declared
can be admissible, which would defeat the legitimate
operations of a supreme government. It is of the
very essence of supremacy to remove all obstacles
to its action within its own sphere, and so to modify
every power vested in subordinate governments
as to exempt its own operations from their own
influence. This effect need not be stated in terms.
It is so involved in the declaration of supremacy,
so necessarily implied in it, that the expression
of it could not make it more certain. We must,
therefore, keep it [the principle of National supremacy]
in view while construing the constitution."<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a></p>

<p>Unlimited as is the power of a State to tax objects
within its jurisdiction, that State power does not
"extend to those means which are employed by Congress
to carry into execution powers conferred on
that body by the people of the United States ...
powers ... given ... to a government whose laws ...
are declared to be supreme.... The right never existed
[in the States] ... to tax the means employed
by the government of the Union, for the execution
of its powers."<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>

<p>Regardless of this fact, however, can States tax
instrumentalities of the National Government? It
cannot be denied, says Marshall, that "the power to
tax involves the power to destroy; that the power
to destroy may defeat ... the power to create; that
there is a plain repugnance, in conferring on one
government a power to control the constitutional
measures of another, which other, with respect to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
those very measures, is declared to be supreme over
that which exerts the control."<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a></p>

<p>Here Marshall permits himself the use of sarcasm,
which he dearly loved but seldom employed. The
State Rights advocates insisted that the States can
be trusted not to abuse their powers&mdash;confidence
must be reposed in State Legislatures and officials;
they would not destroy needlessly, recklessly. "All
inconsistencies are to be reconciled by the magic of
the word <span class="smcap">confidence</span>," says Marshall. "But," he
continues, "is this a case of 'confidence'? Would
the people of any one state trust those of another
with a power to control the most insignificant operations
of their state government? We know they
would not."</p>

<p>By the same token the people of one State would
never consent that the Government of another State
should control the National Government "to which
they have confided the most important and most
valuable interests. In the legislature of the Union
alone, are all represented. The legislature of the
Union alone, therefore, can be trusted by the people
with the power of controlling measures which concern
all, in the confidence that it will not be abused.
This, then, is not a case of confidence."<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a></p>

<p>The State Rights theory is "capable of arresting
all the measures of the government, and of prostrating
it at the foot of the states." Instead of the
National Government being "supreme," as the Constitution
declares it to be, "supremacy" would be
transferred "in fact, to the states"; for, "if the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
states may tax one instrument, employed by the
government in the execution of its powers, they may
tax any and every other instrument. They may tax
the mail; they may tax the mint; they may tax
patent-rights; they may tax the papers of the custom-house;
they may tax judicial process; they may
tax all the means employed by the government, to
an excess which would defeat all the ends of government.
This was not intended by the American people.
They did not design to make their government
dependent on the states."</p>

<p>The whole question is, avows Marshall, "in truth,
a question of supremacy." If the anti-National
principle that the States can tax the instrumentalities
of the National Government is to be sustained,
then the declaration in the Constitution that it and
laws made under it "shall be the supreme law of the
land, is empty and unmeaning declamation."<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a></p>

<p>Maryland had argued that, since the taxing power
is, at least, "concurrent" in the State and National
Governments, the States can tax a National bank as
fully as the Nation can tax State banks. But, remarks
Marshall, "the two cases are not on the same
reason." The whole American people and all the
States are represented in Congress; when they
tax State banks, "they tax their constituents; and
these taxes must be uniform. But, when a state taxes
the operations of the government of the United
States, it acts upon institutions created, not by their
own constituents, but by people over whom they
claim no control. It acts upon the measures of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
government created by others as well as themselves,
for the benefit of others in common with themselves.</p>

<p>"The difference is that which always exists, and
always must exist, between the action of the whole
on a part, and the action of a part on the whole&mdash;between
the laws of a government declared to be
supreme, and those of a government which, when
in opposition to those laws, is not supreme.... The
states have no power, by taxation or otherwise, to
retard, impede, burden, or in any manner control
the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by
Congress to carry into execution the powers vested
in the general government."<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a></p>

<p>For these reasons, therefore, the judgment of the
Supreme Court was that the Maryland law taxing
the Baltimore branch of the National Bank was "contrary
to the constitution ... and void"; that the judgment
of the Baltimore County Court against the
branch bank "be reversed and annulled," and that
the judgment of the Maryland Court of Appeals
affirming the judgment of the County Court also
"be reversed and annulled."<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a></p>

<p>In effect John Marshall thus rewrote the fundamental
law of the Nation; or, perhaps it may be more
accurate to say that he made a written instrument a
living thing, capable of growth, capable of keeping
pace with the advancement of the American people
and ministering to their changing necessities. This
greatest of Marshall's treatises on government may
well be entitled the "Vitality of the Constitution."
Story records that Marshall's opinion aroused great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
political excitement;<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> and no wonder, since the Chief
Justice announced, in principle, that Congress had
sufficient power to "emancipate every slave in the
United States" as John Randolph declared five
years later.<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></p>

<p>Roane, Ritchie, Taylor, and the Republican organization
of Virginia had anticipated that the Chief
Justice would render a Nationalist opinion; but they
were not prepared for the bold and crushing blows
which he rained upon their fanatically cherished theory
of Localism. As soon as they recovered from their
surprise and dismay, they opened fire from their
heaviest batteries upon Marshall and the National
Judiciary. The way was prepared for them by a
preliminary bombardment in the <i>Weekly Register</i> of
Hezekiah Niles.</p>

<p>This periodical had now become the most widely
read and influential publication in the country; it
had subscribers from Portland to New Orleans, from
Savannah to Fort Dearborn. Niles had won the confidence
of his far-flung constituency by his honesty,
courage, and ability. He was the prototype of Horace
Greeley, and the <i>Register</i> had much the same
hold on its readers that the <i>Tribune</i> came to have
thirty years later.</p>

<p>In the first issue of the <i>Register</i>, after Marshall's
opinion was delivered, Niles began an attack upon
it that was to spread all over the land. "A deadly
blow has been struck at the <i>sovereignty of the states</i>,
and from a quarter so far removed from the people
as to be hardly accessible to public opinion," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
wrote. "The welfare of the union has received a
more dangerous wound than fifty <i>Hartford</i> conventions
... could inflict." Parts of Marshall's opinion
are "<i>incomprehensible</i>. But perhaps, as some people
tell us of what <i>they</i> call the <i>mysteries</i> of religion, the
<i>common people</i> are not to understand them, such
things being reserved only for the <i>priests</i>!!"<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a></p>

<p>The opinion of the Chief Justice was published in
full in Niles's <i>Register</i> two weeks after he delivered
it,<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> and was thus given wider publicity than any
judicial utterance previously rendered in America.
Indeed, no pronouncement of any court, except, perhaps,
that in Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden,<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> was read so generally
as Marshall's opinion in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland,
until the publication of the Dred Scott decision
thirty-eight years later. Niles continues his attack
in the number of the <i>Register</i> containing the Bank
opinion:</p>

<p>It is "more important than any ever before pronounced
by that exalted tribunal&mdash;a tribunal so
far removed from the people, that some seem to regard
it with a species of that awful reverence in which
the inhabitants of Asia look up to their princes."<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>
This exasperated sentence shows the change that
Marshall, during his eighteen years on the bench,
had wrought in the standing and repute of the Supreme
Court.<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> The doctrines of the Chief Justice
amount to this, said Niles&mdash;"congress may grant
<i>monopolies</i>" at will, "if the <i>price</i> is paid for them, or
without any pecuniary consideration at all." As for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
the Chief Justice personally, he "has not added ...
to his stock of reputation by writing it&mdash;<i>it is excessively
labored</i>."<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a></p>

<p>Papers throughout the country copied Niles's bitter
criticisms,<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> and public opinion rapidly crystallized
against Marshall's Nationalist doctrine. Every
where the principle asserted by the Chief Justice
became a political issue; or, rather, his declaration,
that that principle was law, made sharper the controversy
that had divided the people since the framing
of the Constitution.</p>

<p>In number after number of his <i>Register</i> Niles, pours
his wrath on Marshall's matchless interpretation.
It is "far more dangerous to the union and happiness
of the people of the United States than ... <i>foreign
invasion</i>.<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> ... Certain nabobs in Boston, New York,
Philadelphia and Baltimore, ... to secure the passage
of an act of <i>incorporation</i>, ... fairly purchase the souls
of some members of the national legislature with
<i>money</i>, as happened in Georgia, or secure the votes of
others by making them <i>stockholders</i>, as occurred in
New York, and the act is passed.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a>... We call upon
the people, the honest people, who hate <i>monopolies</i>
and <i>privileged orders</i>, to arise in their strength and
purge our political temple of the <i>money-changers</i>
and those who sell <i>doves</i>&mdash;causing a reversion to
the original purity of our system of government,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
that the faithful centinel may again say, '<span class="smcap">All's
Well!</span>'"<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a></p>

<p>Extravagant and demagogical as this language of
Niles's now seems, he was sincere and earnest in the
use of it. Copious quotations from the <i>Register</i> have
been here made because it had the strongest influence
on American public opinion of any publication
of its time. Niles's <i>Register</i> was, emphatically, the
mentor of the country editor.<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a></p>

<p>At last the hour had come when the Virginia Republican
triumvirate could strike with an effect impossible
of achievement in 1816 when the Supreme
Court rebuked and overpowered the State appellate
tribunal in Martin <i>vs.</i> Hunter's Lessee.<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> Nobody
outside of Virginia then paid any attention to that
decision, so obsessed was the country by speculation
and seeming prosperity. But in 1819 the collapse
had come; poverty and discontent were universal;
rebellion against Nationalism was under way; and
the vast majority blamed the Bank of the United
States for all their woes. Yet Marshall had upheld
"the monster." The Virginia Junto's opportunity
had arrived.</p>

<p>No sooner had Marshall returned to Richmond
than he got wind of the coming assault upon him.
On March 23, 1819, the <i>Enquirer</i> published his
opinion in full. The next day the Chief Justice wrote
Story: "Our opinion in the Bank case has aroused
the sleeping spirit of Virginia, if indeed it ever sleeps.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
It will, I understand, be attacked in the papers with
some asperity, and as those who favor it never write
for the publick it will remain undefended &amp; of course
be considered as <i>damnably heretical</i>."<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> He had been
correctly informed. The attack came quickly.</p>

<p>On March 30, Spencer Roane opened fire in the
paper of his cousin Thomas Ritchie, the <i>Enquirer</i>,<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a>
under the <i>nom de guerre</i> of "Amphictyon." His first
article is able, calm, and, considering his intense
feelings, fair and moderate. Roane even extols his
enemy:</p>

<p>"That this opinion is very able every one must
admit. This was to have been expected, proceeding
as it does from a man of the most profound legal
attainments, and upon a subject which has employed
his thoughts, his tongue, and his pen, as a politician,
and an historian for more than thirty years. The
subject, too, is one which has, perhaps more than
any other, heretofore drawn a broad line of distinction
between the two great parties in this country,
on which line no one has taken a more distinguished
and decided rank than the judge who has thus expounded
the supreme law of the land. It is not in
my power to carry on a contest upon such a subject
with a man of his gigantic powers."<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a></p>

<p>Niles had spoken to "the plain people"; Roane is
now addressing the lawyers and judges of the country.
His essay is almost wholly a legal argument.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
It is based on the Virginia Resolutions of 1799 and
gives the familiar State Rights arguments, applying
them to Marshall's opinion.<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> In his second article
Roane grows vehement, even fiery, and finally exclaims
that Virginia "never will <i>employ force to support
her doctrines till other measures have entirely
failed</i>."<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a></p>

<p>His attacks had great and immediate response.
No sooner had copies of the <i>Enquirer</i> containing
the first letters of Amphictyon reached Kentucky
than the Republicans of that State declared war
on Marshall. On April 20, the <i>Enquirer</i> printed the
first Western response to Roane's call to arms. Marshall's
principles, said the Kentucky correspondent,
"must raise an alarm throughout our widely extended
empire.... The people must rouse from the
lap of Delilah and prepare to meet the Philistines....
No mind can compass the extent of the encroachments
upon State and individual rights which may
take place under the principles of this decision."<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a></p>

<p>Even Marshall, a political and judicial veteran in
his sixty-fifth year, was perturbed. "The opinion
in the Bank case continues to be denounced by
the democracy in Virginia," he writes Story, after the
second of Roane's articles appeared. "An effort is
certainly making to induce the legislature which
will meet in December to take up the subject &amp; to
pass resolutions not very unlike those which were
called forth by the alien &amp; sedition laws in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
1799. Whether the effort will be successful or not may
perhaps depend in some measure on the sentiments
of our sister states. To excite this ferment the
opinion has been grossly misrepresented; and where
its argument has been truly stated it has been met
by principles one would think too palpably absurd
for intelligent men.</p>

<p>"But," he gloomily continues, "prejudice will
swallow anything. If the principles which have been
advanced on this occasion were to prevail the constitution
would be converted into the old confederation."<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a></p>

<p>As yet Roane had struck but lightly. He now
renewed the Republican offensive with greater spirit.
During June, 1819, the <i>Enquirer</i> published four articles
signed "Hampden," from Roane's pen. Ritchie
introduced the "Hampden" essays in an editorial in
which he urged the careful reading of the exposure
"of the alarming errors of the Supreme Court....
Whenever State rights are threatened or invaded,
Virginia will not be the last to sound the tocsin."<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<p>Are the people prepared "to give <i>carte blanche</i>
to our federal rulers"? asked Hampden. Amendment
of the Constitution by judicial interpretation
is taking the place of amendment by the people.
Infamous as the methods of National judges had
been during the administration of Adams, "the
most abandoned of our rulers," Marshall and his
associates have done worse. They have given "a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
<i>general</i> letter of attorney to the future legislators of
the Union.... That man must be a deplorable idiot
who does not see that there is no ... difference" between
an "<i>unlimited</i> grant of power and a grant
limited in its terms, but accompanied with <i>unlimited</i>
means of carrying it into execution.... The crisis is
one which portends destruction to the liberties of
the American people." Hampden scoldingly adds:
"If Mason or Henry could lift their patriot heads
from the grave, ... they would almost exclaim, with
Jugurtha, 'Venal people! you will soon perish if you
can find a purchaser.'"<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a></p>

<p>For three more numbers Hampden pressed the
Republican assault on Marshall's opinion. The
Constitution is a "<i>compact</i>, to which the <i>States</i> are
the parties." Marshall's argument in the Virginia
Convention of 1788 is quoted,<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> and his use of certain
terms in his "Life of Washington" is cited.<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> If the
powers of the National Government ought to be
enlarged, "let this be the act of the <i>people</i>, and not
that of subordinate agents."<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> The opinion of the
Chief Justice repeatedly declares "that the general
government, though limited in its powers, is supreme."
Hampden avows that he does "not understand
this jargon.... The <i>people</i> only are supreme.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a>...
Our general government ... is as much a ... 'league'
as was the former confederation." Therefore, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
Virginia Court of Appeals, in Hunter <i>vs.</i> Fairfax,
declared an act of Congress "unconstitutional, although
it had been sanctioned by the opinion of the
Supreme Court of the United States." Pennsylvania,
too, had maintained its "sovereignty."<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a></p>

<p>Hampden has only scorn for "<i>some</i> of the judges"
who concurred in the opinion of the Chief Justice.
They "had before been accounted republicans....
Few men come out from high places, as pure as they
went in."<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> If Marshall's doctrine stands, "the triumph
over our liberties will be ... easy and complete."
What, then, could "arrest this calamity"?
Nothing but an "appeal" to the people. Let this
majestic and irresistible power be invoked.<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a></p>

<p>That he had no faith in his own theory is proved
by the rather dismal fact that, more than two
months before Marshall "violated the Constitution"
and "endangered the liberties" of the people by
his Bank decision, Roane actually arranged for the
purchase, as an investment for his son, of $4900
worth of the shares of the Bank of the United
States, and actually made the investment.<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> This
transaction, consummated even before the argument<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland, shows that Roane, the
able lawyer, was sure that Marshall would and ought
to sustain the Bank in its controversy with the States
that were trying to destroy it. Moreover, Dr. John
Brockenbrough, President of the Bank of Virginia,
actually advised the investment.<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a></p>

<p>It is of moment, too, to note at this point the
course taken by Marshall, who had long owned
stock in the Bank of the United States. As soon as
he learned that the suit had been brought which, of
a certainty, must come before him, the Chief Justice
disposed of his holdings.<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a></p>

<p>So disturbed was Marshall by Roane's attacks
that he did a thoroughly uncharacteristic thing.
By way of reply to Roane he wrote, under the <i>nom
de guerre</i> of "A Friend of the Union," an elaborate
defense of his opinion and, through Bushrod
Washington, procured the publication of it in the
<i>Union</i> of Philadelphia, the successor of the <i>Gazette
of the United States</i>, and the strongest Federalist
newspaper then surviving.</p>

<p>On June 28, 1819, the Chief Justice writes Washington:
"I expected three numbers would have concluded
my answer to Hampden but I must write
two others which will follow in a few days. If the
publication has not commenced I could rather wish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
the signature to be changed to 'A Constitutionalist.'
A Friend of the Constitution is so much like a Friend
of the Union that it may lead to some suspicion of
identity.... I hope the publication has commenced
unless the Editor should be unwilling to devote so
much of his paper to this discussion. The letters of
Amphyction &amp; of Hampden have made no great
impression in Richmond but they were designed for
the country [Virginia] &amp; have had considerable influence
there. I wish the refutation to be in the
hands of some respectable members of the legislature
as it may prevent some act of the assembly [torn&mdash;probably
"both"] silly &amp; wicked. If the publication
be made I should [like] to have two or three sets of
the papers to hand if necessary. I will settle with
you for the printer."<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a></p>

<p>The reading of Marshall's newspaper effort is
exhausting; a summary of the least uninteresting
passages will give an idea of the whole paper. The
articles published in the <i>Enquirer</i> were intended,
so he wrote, to inflict "deep wounds on the constitution,"
are full of "mischievous errours," and are
merely new expressions of the old Virginia spirit of
hostility to the Nation. The case of M'Culloch <i>vs.</i>
Maryland serves only as an excuse "for once more
agitating the publick mind, and reviving those unfounded
jealousies by whose blind aid ambition
climbs the ladder of power."<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>After a long introduction, Marshall enters upon
his defense which is as wordy as his answer to the
Virginia Resolutions. He is sensitive over the charge,
by now popularly made, that he controls the Supreme
Court, and cites the case of the Nereid to
prove that the Justices give dissenting opinions
whenever they choose. "The course of every tribunal
must necessarily be, that the opinion which
is to be delivered as the opinion of the court, is
previously submitted to the consideration of all the
judges; and, if any part of the reasoning be disapproved,
it must be so modified as to receive the
approbation of all, before it can be delivered as
the opinion of all."</p>

<p>Roane's personal charges amount to this: "The
chief justice ... is a federalist; who was a politician
of some note before he was judge; and who with his
tongue and his pen supported the opinions he
avowed." With the politician's skill Marshall uses
the fact that the majority of the court, which gave
the Nationalist judgment in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland,
were Republicans&mdash;"four of whom [Story,
Johnson, Duval, and Livingston] have no political
sin upon their heads;&mdash;who in addition to being
eminent lawyers, have the still greater advantage
of being sound republicans; of having been selected
certainly not for their federalism, by Mr Jefferson,
and Mr Madison, for the high stations they so properly
fill." For eight tedious columns of diffuse repetition
Marshall goes on in defense of his opinion.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a></p>

<p>When the biographer searches the daily life of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
man so surpassingly great and good as Marshall, he
hopes in no ungenerous spirit to find some human
frailty that identifies his hero with mankind. The
Greeks did not fail to connect their deities with humanity.
The leading men of American history have
been ill-treated in this respect&mdash;for a century they
have been held up to our vision as superhuman
creatures to admire whom was a duty, to criticize
whom was a blasphemy, and to love or understand
whom was an impossibility.</p>

<p>All but Marshall have been rescued from this
frigid isolation. Any discovery of human frailty in
the great Chief Justice is, therefore, most welcome.
Some small and gracious defects in Marshall's character
have appeared in the course of these volumes;
and this additional evidence of his susceptibility
to ordinary emotion is very pleasing. With all his
stern repression of that element of his character, we
find that he was sensitive in the extreme; in reality,
thirsting for approval, hurt by criticism. In spite
of this desire for applause and horror of rebuke,
however, he did his duty, knowing beforehand that
his finest services would surely bring upon him the
denunciation and abuse he so disliked. By such
peevishness as his anonymous reply in the <i>Union</i> to
Roane's irritating attacks, we are able to get some
measure of the true proportions of this august yet
very human character.</p>

<p>When Marshall saw, in print, this controversial
product of his pen, he was disappointed and depressed.
The editor had, he avowed, so confused
the manuscript that it was scarcely intelligible. At<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
any rate, Marshall did not want his defense reproduced
in New England. Story had heard of the
article in the <i>Union</i>, and wrote Marshall that he
wished to secure the publication of it. The Chief
Justice replied:</p>

<p>"The piece to which you allude was not published
in Virginia. Our patriotic papers admit no such
political heresies. It contained, I think, a complete
demonstration of the fallacies &amp; errors contained in
those attacks on the opinion of the Court which
have most credit here &amp; are supposed to proceed
from a high source,<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> but was so mangled in the publication
that those only who had bestowed close
attention to the subject could understand it.</p>

<p>"There were two numbers<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> &amp; the editor of the
Union in Philadelphia, the paper in which it was
published, had mixed the different numbers together
so as in several instances to place the
reasoning intended to demonstrate one proposition
under another. The points &amp; the arguments were so
separated from each other, &amp; so strangely mixed as
to constitute a labyrinth to which those only who
understood the whole subject perfectly could find
a clue."<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a></p>

<p>It appears that Story insisted on having at least
Marshall's rejoinder to Roane's first article reproduced
in the Boston press. Again the Chief Justice
evades the request of his associate and confidant:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
"I do not think a republication of the piece you
mention in the Boston papers to be desired, as the
antifederalism of Virginia will not, I trust, find its
way to New England. I should also be sorry to see
it in Mr. Wheaton's<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> appendix because that circumstance
might lead to suspicions regarding the author
&amp; because I should regret to see it republished in its
present deranged form with the two centres transposed."<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a></p>

<p>For a brief space, then, the combatants rested on
their arms, but each was only gathering strength
for the inevitable renewal of the engagement which
was to be sterner than any previous phases of the
contest.</p>

<p>Soon after the convening of the first session of the
Virginia Legislature held subsequent to the decision
of M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland, Roane addressed the
lawmakers through the <i>Enquirer</i>, now signing himself
"Publicola." He pointed out the "absolute
disqualification of the supreme court of the U. S. to
decide with impartiality upon controversies between
the General and State Governments";<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> and, to
"ensure <i>unbiassed</i>" decisions, insisted upon a Constitutional
amendment to establish a tribunal "(as
occasion may require)" appointed partly by the
States and partly by the National Government,
"with <i>appellate</i> jurisdiction from the present supreme
court."<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a></p>

<p>Promptly a resolution against Marshall's opinion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
was offered in the House of Delegates.<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> This noteworthy
paper was presented by Andrew Stevenson,
a member of the "committee for Courts of Justice."<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>
The resolutions declared that the doctrines
of M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland would "undermine the
pillars of the Constitution itself." The provision
giving to the judicial power "<i>all cases</i> arising <i>under
the Constitution</i>" did not "extend to questions which
would amount to a subversion of the constitution
itself, by the usurpation of one contracting party
on another." But Marshall's opinion was calculated
to "change the whole character of the government."<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a></p>

<p>Sentences from the opinion of the Chief Justice
are quoted, including the famous one: "Let the
end be legitimate, ... and all the means which are
appropriate, ... which are not prohibited, ... are
constitutional." Did not such expressions import
that Congress could "conform the constitution to
their own designs" by the exercise of "unlimited
and uncontrouled" power? The ratifying resolution
of the Constitution by the Virginia Convention of
1788 is quoted.<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> Virginia's voice had been heard
to the same effect in the immortal Resolutions of
1799. Her views had been endorsed by the country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
in the Presidential election of 1800&mdash;that "great
revolution of principle." Her Legislature, therefore,
"enter their most solemn protest, against the decision
of the supreme court, and of the principles
contained in it."</p>

<p>In this fashion the General Assembly insisted on
an amendment to the National Constitution "creating
a <i>tribunal</i>" authorized to decide questions relative
to the "powers of the general and state governments,
under the compact." The Virginia Senators
are, therefore, instructed to do their best to secure
such an amendment and "to resist on every occasion"
attempted legislation by Congress in conflict
with the views set forth in this resolution or those
of 1799 "which have been re-considered, and are
fully and entirely approved of by this Assembly."
The Governor is directed to transmit the resolutions
to the other States.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a></p>

<p>At this point Slavery and Secession enter upon
the scene. Almost simultaneously with the introduction
of the resolutions denouncing Marshall and
the Supreme Court for the judgment and opinion
in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland, other resolutions were
offered by a member of the House named Baldwin
denouncing the imposition of restrictions on Missouri
(the prohibition of slavery) as a condition of admitting
that Territory to the Union. Such action by
Congress would "excite feelings eminently hostile
to the fraternal affection and prudent forbearance
which ought ever to pervade the confederated
union."<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> Two days later, December 30, the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
delegate introduced resolutions to the effect that
only the maintenance of the State Rights principle
could "preserve the confederated union," since
"no government can long exist which lies at the
mercy of another"; and, inferentially, that Marshall's
opinion in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland had violated
that principle.<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a></p>

<p>A yet sterner declaration on the Missouri question
quickly followed, declaring that Congress had no
power to prohibit slavery in that State, and that
"Virginia will support the good people of Missouri
in their just rights ... and will co-operate with them
in resisting with manly fortitude any attempt
which Congress may make to impose restraints or
restrictions as the price of their admission" to the
Union.<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> The next day these resolutions, strengthened
by amendment, were adopted.<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> On February
12, 1820, the resolutions condemning the Nationalist
doctrine expounded by the Chief Justice in the
Bank case also came to a vote and passed, 117
ayes to 38 nays.<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> They had been amended and reamended,<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a>
but, as adopted, they were in substance
the same as those originally offered by Stevenson.
Through both these sets of resolutions&mdash;that on
the Missouri question and that on the Bank decision&mdash;ran
the intimation of forcible resistance to
National authority. Introduced at practically the
same time, drawn and advocated by the same men,
passed by votes of the same members, these important
declarations of the Virginia Legislature were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
meant to be and must be considered as a single expression
of the views of Virginia upon National policy.</p>

<p>In this wise did the Legislature of his own State
repudiate and defy that opinion of John Marshall
which has done more for the American Nation than
any single utterance of any other one man, excepting
only the Farewell Address of Washington.
In such manner, too, was the slavery question
brought face to face with Marshall's lasting exposition
of the National Constitution. For, it should
be repeated, in announcing the principles by virtue
of which Congress could establish the Bank of
the United States, the Chief Justice had also asserted,
by necessary inference, the power of the National
Legislature to exact the exclusion of slavery
as a condition upon which a State could be admitted
to the Union. At least this was the interpretation
of Virginia and the South.</p>

<p>The slavery question did not, to be sure, closely
touch Northern States, but their local interests did.
Thus it was that Ohio aligned herself with Virginia
in opposition to Marshall's Nationalist statesmanship,
and in support of the Jeffersonian doctrine of
Localism. In such fashion did the Ohio Bank question
become so intermingled with the conflict over
Slavery and Secession that, in the consideration of
Marshall's opinions at this time, these controversies
cannot be separated. The facts of the Ohio Bank
case must, therefore, be given at this point.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a></p>

<p>Since the establishment at Cincinnati, early in
1817, of a branch of the Bank of the United States,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
Ohio had threatened to drive it from the State by
a prohibitive tax. Not long before the argument of
M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland in the Supreme Court, the
Ohio Legislature laid an annual tax of $50,000 on
each of the two branches which, by that time, had
been established in that State.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> On February 8, 1819,
only four days previous to the hearing of the Maryland
case at Washington, and less than a month before
Marshall delivered his opinion, the Ohio lawmakers
passed an act directing the State Auditor,
Ralph Osborn, to charge this tax of $50,000 against
each of the branches, and to issue a warrant for the
immediate collection of $100,000, the total amount
of the first year's tax.</p>

<p>This law is almost without parallel in severity,
peremptoriness, and defiant contempt for National
authority. If the branches refused to pay the tax,
the Ohio law enjoined the person serving the State
Auditor's warrant to seize all money or property belonging
to the Bank, found on its premises or elsewhere.
The agent of the Auditor was directed to
open the vaults, search the offices, and take everything
of value.<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a></p>

<p>Immediately the branch at Chillicothe obtained
from the United States District Court, then in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
session at that place, an injunction forbidding
Osborn from collecting the tax;<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> but the bank's
counsel forgot to have a writ issued to stay the
proceedings. Therefore, no order of the court was
served; instead a copy of the bill praying that the
Auditor be restrained, together with a subp&#339;na to
answer, was sent to Osborn. These papers were not,
of course, an injunction, but merely notice that one
had been applied for. Thinking to collect the tax
before the injunction could be issued, Osborn forthwith
issued his Auditor's warrant to one John L.
Harper to collect the tax immediately. Assisted by
a man named Thomas Orr, Harper entered the
Chillicothe branch of the Bank of the United States,
opened the vaults, seized all the money to be found,
and deposited it for the night in the local State bank.
Next morning Harper and Orr loaded the specie,
bank notes, and other securities in a wagon and
started for Columbus.<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a></p>

<p>The branch bank tardily obtained an order from
the United States Court restraining Osborn, the
State Auditor, and Harper, the State agent, from delivering
the money to the State Treasurer and from
making any report to the Legislature of the collection
of the tax. This writ was served on Harper as he
and Orr were on the road to the State Capital with
the money. Harper simply ignored the writ, drove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
on to Columbus, and handed over to the State
Treasurer the funds which he had seized at Chillicothe.</p>

<p>Harper and Orr were promptly arrested and imprisoned
in the jail at Chillicothe.<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> Because of technical
defects in serving the warrant for their arrest
and in the return of the marshal, the prisoners were
set free.<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> An order was secured from the United
States Court directing Osborn and Harper to show
cause why an attachment should not be issued against
them for having disobeyed the court's injunction not
to deliver the bank's money to the State Treasurer.
After extended argument, the court issued the attachment,
which, however, was not made returnable
until the January term, 1821.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Virginia Legislature passed its
resolutions denouncing Marshall's opinion in M'Culloch
<i>vs.</i> Maryland, and throughout the country the
warfare upon the Supreme Court began. The Legislature
of Ohio acted with a celerity and boldness
that made the procedure of the Virginia Legislature
seem hesitant and timid. A joint committee was
speedily appointed and as promptly made its report.
This report and the resolutions recommended by it
were adopted without delay and transmitted to the
Senate of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a></p>

<p>The Ohio declaration is drawn with notable
ability. A State cannot be sued&mdash;the true meaning
of the Constitution forbids, and the Eleventh
Amendment specifically prohibits, such procedure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the action against Osborn, State Auditor, and
Samuel Sullivan, State Treasurer, is, "to every substantial
purpose, a process against the State." The
decision of the National Supreme Court that the
States have no power to tax branches of the Bank of
the United States does not bind Ohio or render her
tax law "a dead letter."<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a></p>

<p>The Ohio Legislature challenges the <i>bona fides</i> of
M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland: "If, by the management of
a party, and through the inadvertence or connivance
of a State, a case be made, presenting to the Supreme
Court of the United States for decision important ...
questions of State power and State authority, upon
no just principle ought the States to be concluded
by any decision had upon such a case.... Such is the
true character of the case passed upon the world by
the title of McCulloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland," which, "when
looked into, is found to be ... throughout, an agreed
case, made expressly for the purpose of obtaining the
opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States....
This agreed case was manufactured in the summer
of the year 1818" and rushed through two
Maryland courts, "so as to be got upon the docket
of the Supreme Court of the United States for adjudication
at their February term, 1819.... It is truly
an alarming circumstance if it be in the power of an
aspiring corporation and an unknown and obscure
individual thus to elicit opinions compromitting the
vital interests of the States that compose the American
Union."</p>

<p>Luckily for Ohio and all the States, this report<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
goes on to say, some of Marshall's opinions have
been "totally impotent and unavailing," as, for instance,
in the case of Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison. Marbury
did not get his commission; "the person appointed
in his place continued to act; his acts
were admitted to be valid; and President Jefferson
retained his standing in the estimation of the American
people." It was the same in the case of Fletcher
<i>vs.</i> Peck. Marshall held that "the Yazoo purchasers
... were entitled to their lands. But the
decision availed them nothing, unless as a make-weight
in effecting a compromise." Since, in neither
of these cases, had the National Government paid
the slightest attention to the decision of the Supreme
Court, how could Ohio "be condemned because
she did not abandon her solemn legislative
acts as a dead letter upon the promulgation of an
opinion of that tribunal"?<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a></p>

<p>The Ohio Legislature then proceeds to analyze
Marshall's opinion in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland. All
the arguments made against the principle of implied
powers since Hamilton first announced that principle,<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>
and all the reasons advanced against the doctrine
that the National Government is supreme, in
the sense employed by Marshall, are restated with
clearness and power. However, since the object of
the tax was to drive the branches of the Bank out
of Ohio, the Legislature suggests a compromise. If
the National institution will cease business within
the State and "give assurance" that the branches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
be withdrawn, the State will refund the tax money
it has seized.<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a></p>

<p>Instantly turning from conciliation to defiance,
"because the reputation of the State has been assailed,"
the Legislature challenges the National Government
to make good Marshall's assertion that the
power which created the Bank "must have the power
to preserve it." Ohio should pass laws "forbidding
the keepers of our jails from receiving into their custody
any person committed at the suit of the Bank
of the United States," and prohibiting Ohio judges,
recorders, notaries public, from recognizing that institution
in any way.<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> Congress will then have to
provide a criminal code, a system of conveyances,
and other extensive measures. Ohio and the country
will then learn whether the power that created
the Bank can preserve it.</p>

<p>The Ohio memorial concludes with a denial that
the "political rights" and "sovereign powers" of
a State can be settled by the Supreme Court of the
Nation "in cases contrived between individuals, and
where they [the States] are, no one of them, parties
direct." The resolutions further declare that the
opinion of the other States should be secured.<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> This
alarming manifesto was presented to the National
Senate on February 1, 1821, just six weeks before
Marshall delivered the opinion of the Supreme Court
in Cohens <i>vs.</i> Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a></p>

<p>Pennsylvania had already taken stronger measures;
had anticipated even Virginia. Within seven weeks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
from the delivery of Marshall's opinion in M'Culloch
<i>vs.</i> Maryland, the Legislature of Pennsylvania proposed
an amendment to the National Constitution
prohibiting Congress from authorizing "any bank
or other monied institution" outside of the District
of Columbia.<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> The action of Ohio was an endorsement
of that of Virginia and Pennsylvania. Indiana
had already swung into line.<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> So had Illinois and
Tennessee.<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> For some reason, Kentucky, soon to become
one of the most belligerent and persevering of
all the States in her resistance to the "encroachments"
of Nationalism as expounded by the Supreme
Court, withheld her hand for the moment.</p>

<p>Most unaccountably, South Carolina actually upheld
Marshall's opinion,<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> which that State, within
a decade, was to repudiate, denounce, and defy in
terms of armed resistance.<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> New York and Massachusetts,<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>
consulting their immediate interests, were
very stern against the Localism of Ohio, Virginia, and
Pennsylvania.<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> Georgia expressed her sympathy
with the Localist movement, but, for the time being,
was complaisant<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>&mdash;a fact the more astonishing that
she had already proved, and was soon to prove
again, that Nationalism is a fantasy unless it is
backed by force.<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the eccentric attitude of various
members of the Union, it was only too plain that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
a powerful group of States were acting in concert and
that others ardently sympathized with them.</p>

<p>At this point, in different fashion, Virginia spoke
again, this time by the voice of that great protagonist
of Localism, John Taylor of Caroline, the originator
of the Kentucky Resolutions,<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> and the most brilliant
mind in the Republican organization of the Old
Dominion. Immediately after Marshall's opinion in
M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland, and while the Ohio conflict
was in progress, he wrote a book in denunciation and
refutation of Marshall's Nationalist principles. The
editorial by Thomas Ritchie, commending Taylor's
book, declares that "the crisis has come"; the Missouri
question, the Tariff question, the Bank question,
have brought the country to the point where a decision
must be made as to whether the National
Government shall be permitted to go on with its usurpations.
"If there is any book capable of arousing
the people, it is the one before us."</p>

<p>Taylor gave to his volume the title "Construction
Construed, and Constitutions Vindicated." The
phrases "exclusive interests" and "exclusive privileges"
abound throughout the volume. Sixteen
chapters compose this classic of State Rights philosophy.
Five of them are devoted to Marshall's opinion
in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland; the others to theories
of government, the state of the country, the
protective tariff, and the Missouri question. The
principles of the Revolution, avows Taylor, "are
the keys of construction" and "the locks of liberty.<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a>... No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
form of government can foster a fanaticism for
wealth, without being corrupted." Yet Marshall's
ideas establish "the despotick principle of a gratuitous
distribution of wealth and poverty by law."<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a></p>

<p>If the theory that Congress can create corporations
should prevail, "legislatures will become colleges for
teaching the science of getting money by monopolies
or favours."<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> To pretend faith in Christianity, and
yet foster monopoly, is "like placing Christ on the
car of Juggernaut."<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> The framers of the National
Constitution tried to prevent the evils of monopoly
and avarice by "restricting the powers given to
Congress" and safeguarding those of the States; "in
fact, by securing the freedom of property."<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a></p>

<p>Marshall is enamored of the word "sovereignty,"
an "equivocal and illimitable word," not found in
"the declaration of independence, nor the federal constitution,
nor the constitution of any single state";
all of them repudiated it "as a traitor of civil rights."<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a>
Well that they had so rejected this term of despotism!
No wonder Jugurtha exclaimed, "Rome was
for sale," when "the government exercised an absolute
power over the national property." Of course
it would "find purchasers."<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> To this condition
Marshall's theories will bring America.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;">

<span class="caption">JOHN TAYLOR</span>
</div>
<p>Whence this effort to endow the National Government
with powers comparable to those of a monarchy?
Plainly it is a reaction&mdash;"many wise and
good men, ... alarmed by the illusions of Rousseau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
and Godwin, and the atrocities of the French revolution,
honestly believe that these [democratic]
principles have teeth and claws, which it is expedient
to draw and pare, however constitutional they
may be; without considering that such an operation
will subject the generous lion to the wily fox; ... subject
liberty and property to tyranny and fraud."<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a></p>

<p>In chapter after chapter of clever arguments,
illumined by the sparkle of such false gems as these
quotations, Taylor prepares the public mind for his
direct attack on John Marshall. He is at a sad disadvantage;
he, "an unknown writer," can offer only
"an artless course of reasoning" against the "acute
argument" of Marshall's opinion, concurred in by
the members of the Supreme Court whose "talents,"
"integrity," "uprightness," and "erudition" are
universally admitted.<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> The essence of Marshall's
doctrine is that, although the powers of the National
Government are limited, the means by which they
may be executed are unlimited. But, "as ends may
be made to beget means, so means may be made
to beget ends, until the co-habitation shall rear a
progeny of unconstitutional bastards, which were
not begotten by the people."<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a></p>

<p>Marshall had said that "'the creation of a corporation
appertains to sovereignty.'" This is the
language of tyranny. The corporate idea crept into
British law "wherein it hides the heart of a prostitute
under the habiliments of a virgin."<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> But since,
in America, only the people are "sovereign," and,
to use Marshall's own words, the power to create<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
corporations "appertains to sovereignty," it follows
that neither State nor National Governments can
create corporations.<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a></p>

<p>The Chief Justice is a master of the "science of
verbality" by which the Constitution may be rendered
"as unintelligible, as a single word would be
made by a syllabick dislocation, or a jumble of its
letters; and turn it into a reservoir of every meaning
for which its expounder may have occasion."</p>

<p>Where does Marshall's "artifice of verbalizing"
lead?<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> To an "artificially reared, a monied interest
... which is gradually obtaining an influence over
the federal government," and "craftily works upon
the passions of the states it has been able to delude"
[on the slavery question], "to coerce the defrauded
and discontented states into submission." For
this reason talk of civil war abounds. "For what
are the states talking about disunion, and for what
are they going to war among themselves? To create
or establish a monied sect, composed of privileged
combinations, as an aristocratical oppressor of them
all."<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> Marshall's doctrine that Congress may bestow
"exclusive privileges" is at the bottom of the
Missouri controversy. "Had the motive ... never
existed, the discussion itself would never have existed;
but if the same cause continues, more fatal
controversies may be expected."<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally Taylor hurls at the Nation the challenge
of the South, which the representatives of that section,
from the floor of Congress, quickly repeated in
threatenings of civil war.<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> "There remains a right,
anterior to every political power whatsoever, ... the
natural right of self-defence.... It is allowed, on all
hands, that danger to the slave-holding states lurks
in their existing situation, ... and it must be admitted
that the right of self-defence applies to that situation....
I leave to the reader the application of these
observations."<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a></p>

<p>Immediately upon its publication, Ritchie sent a
copy of Taylor's book to Jefferson, who answered
that he knew "before reading it" that it would prove
"orthodox." The attack upon the National courts
could not be pressed too energetically: "The judiciary
of the United States is the subtle corps of sappers
and miners constantly working under ground to
undermine the foundations of our confederated fabric....
An opinion is huddled up in conclave, perhaps
by a majority of one, delivered as if unanimous, and
with the silent acquiescence of lazy and timid associates,
by a crafty chief judge, who sophisticates the
law to his mind, by the turn of his own reasoning."<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a></p>

have deemed it of some importance, in the construction of the
constitution, to consider that instrument not as emanating from the
people, but as the act of sovereign and independent states. The
powers of the general government, it has been said, are delegated by
the states, who alone are truly sovereign; and must be exercised in
subordination to the states, who alone possess supreme dominion.
</p><p>
"It would be difficult to sustain this proposition. The convention
which framed the constitution was indeed elected by the state legislatures.
But the instrument, when it came from their hands, was a
mere proposal, without obligation, or pretensions to it. It was reported
to the then existing Congress of the United States, with a
request that it might 'be submitted to a convention of delegates, chosen
in each state, by the people thereof, under the recommendation of its
legislature, for their assent and ratification.' This mode of proceeding
was adopted; and by the convention, by Congress, and by the state
legislatures, the instrument was submitted to the people.
</p><p>
"They acted upon it in the only manner in which they can act safely,
effectively, and wisely, on such a subject, by assembling in convention.
It is true, they assembled in their several states&mdash;and where else
should they have assembled? No political dreamer was ever wild
enough to think of breaking down the lines which separate the states,
and of compounding the American people into one common mass. Of
consequence, when they act, they act in their states. But the measures
they adopt do not, on that account, cease to be the measures of the
people themselves, or become the measures of the state governments.
From these conventions the constitution derives its whole authority."
(4 Wheaton, 402-03.)</p></div>

their language is so similar that it seems not unlikely that Lincoln paraphrased
this noble passage of Marshall and thus made it immortal.
This probability is increased by the fact that Lincoln was a profound
student of Marshall's Constitutional opinions and committed a great
many of them to memory.
</p><p>
The famous sentence of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address was, however,
almost exactly given by Webster in his Reply to Hayne: "It
is ... the people's Government; made for the people; made by the
people; and answerable to the people." (<i>Debates</i>, 21st Cong. 1st Sess.
74; also Curtis, I, 355-61.) But both Lincoln and Webster merely
stated in condensed and simpler form Marshall's immortal utterance
in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland. (See also <i>infra</i>, chap. <span class="smcap">x</span>.)</p></div>

the tax, if he cannot readily find in the bank offices the necessary
amount of money, "to go into each and any other room or vault ...

It is interesting to observe that Taylor brands the protective tariff
as one of the evils of Marshall's Nationalist philosophy. "It destroys
the division of powers between federal and state governments, ... it
violates the principles of representation, ... it recognizes a sovereign
power over property, ... it destroys the freedom of labour, ... it taxes
the great mass of capital and labour, to enrich the few; ... it increases
the burden upon the people ... increases the mass of poverty; ... it
impoverishes workmen and enriches employers; ... it increases the
expenses of government, ... it deprives commerce of the freedom of
exchanges, ... it corrupts congress ... generates the extremes of luxury
and poverty." (Taylor: <i>Construction Construed</i>, 252-53.)</p></div>

<h3>THREATS OF WAR</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Cannot the Union exist unless Congress and the Supreme Court shall make
banks and lotteries? (John Taylor "of Caroline.")</p>

<p>If a judge can repeal a law of Congress, by declaring it unconstitutional, is
not this the exercise of political power? (Senator Richard M. Johnson.)</p>

<p>The States must shield themselves and meet the invader foot to foot.
(Jefferson.)</p>

<p>The United States ... form a single nation. In war we are one people. In
making peace we are one people. In all commercial regulations we are one
and the same people. (Marshall.)</p>

<p>The crisis has arrived contemplated by the framers of the Constitution.
(Senator James Barbour.)</p>
</div>


<p>The appeals of Niles, Roane, and Taylor, and the
defiant attitude toward Nationalism of Virginia,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and other States, expressed a
widespread and militant Localism which now manifested
itself in another and still more threatening
form. The momentous and dramatic struggle in Congress
over the admission of Missouri quickly followed
these attacks on Marshall and the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Should that Territory come into the Union only
on condition that slavery be prohibited within the
new State, or should the slave system be retained?
The clamorous and prophetic debate upon that question
stirred the land from Maine to Louisiana. A division
of the Union was everywhere discussed, and
the right of a State to secede was boldly proclaimed.</p>

<p>In the House and Senate, civil war was threatened.
"I fear this subject will be an ignited spark, which,
communicated to an immense mass of combustion,
will produce an explosion that will shake this Union
to its centre.... The crisis has arrived, contemplated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
by the framers of the Constitution.... This portentous
subject, twelve months ago, was a little speck
scarcely visible above the horizon; it has already
overcast the heavens, obscuring every other object;
materials are everywhere accumulating with which
to render it darker."<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> In these bombastic, yet serious
words Senator James Barbour of Virginia, when
speaking on the Missouri question on January 14,
1820, accurately described the situation.</p>

<p>"I behold the father armed against the son, ... a
brother's sword crimsoned with a brother's blood, ...
our houses wrapt in flames," exclaimed Senator
Freeman Walker of Georgia. "If Congress ... impose
the restriction contemplated [exclusion of
slavery from Missouri], ... consequences fatal to the
peace and harmony of this Union will ... result."<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a>
Senator William Smith of South Carolina asked "if,
under the misguided influence of fanaticism and
humanity, the impetuous torrent is once put in motion,
what hand short of Omnipotence can stay it?"<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a>
In picturing the coming horrors Senator Richard
Mentor Johnson of Kentucky declared that "the
heart sickens, the tongue falters."<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a></p>

<p>In the House was heard language even more sanguinary.
"Let gentlemen beware!" exclaimed Robert
Raymond Reid of Georgia; for to put limits on
slavery was to implant "envy, hatred, and bitter
reproaches, which</p>

<p class="poem">
'Shall grow to clubs and naked swords,<br />
To murder and to death.'...<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p class="noidt">Sir, the firebrand, which is even now cast into your

<p>Only a few Northern members answered with
spirit. Senator Walter Lowrie of Pennsylvania preferred
"a dissolution of this Union" rather than "the
extension of slavery."<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> Daniel Pope Cook of Illinois
avowed that "the sound of disunion ... has been
uttered so often in this debate, ... that it is high time
... to adopt measures to prevent it.... Such declarations
... will have no ... effect upon me.... Is it ...
the intention of gentlemen to arouse ... the South to
rebellion?"<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> For the most part, however, Northern
Representatives were mild and even hopeful.<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a></p>

<p>Such was the situation concerning which John
Marshall addressed the American people in his
epochal opinion in the case of Cohens <i>vs.</i> Virginia.
The noble passages of that remarkable state paper
were inspired by, and can be understood only in the
light of, the crisis that produced them. Not in
the mere facts of that insignificant case, not in the
precise legal points involved, is to be found the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>inspiration of Marshall's transcendent effort on this
occasion. Indeed, it is possible, as the Ohio Legislature
and the Virginia Republican organization soon
thereafter charged, that Cohens <i>vs.</i> Virginia was
"feigned" for the purpose of enabling Marshall to
assert once more the supremacy of the Nation.</p>

<p>If the case came before Marshall normally, without
design and in the regular course of business, it was
an event nothing short of providential. If, on the
contrary, it was "arranged" so that Marshall could
deliver his immortal Nationalist address, never was
such contrivance so thoroughly justified. While the
legal profession has always considered this case to
be identical, judicially, with that of Martin <i>vs.</i> Hunter's
Lessee, it is, historically, a part of M'Culloch <i>vs.</i>
Maryland and of Osborn <i>vs.</i> The Bank. The opinion
of John Marshall in the Cohens case is one of the
strongest and most enduring strands of that mighty
cable woven by him to hold the American people
together as a united and imperishable nation.</p>

<p>Fortunate, indeed, for the Republic that Marshall's
fateful pronouncement came forth at such a
critical hour, even if technicalities were waived in
bringing before him a case in which he could deliver
that opinion. For, in conjunction with his exposition
in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland, it was the most powerful
answer that could be given, and from the source
of greatest authority, to that defiance of the National
Government and to the threats of disunion then
growing ever bolder and more vociferous. Marshall's
utterances did not still those hostile voices, it is true,
but they gave strength and courage to Nationalists<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
and furnished to the champions of the Union arguments
of peculiar force as coming from the supreme
tribunal of the Nation.</p>

<p>Could John Marshall have seen into the future
he would have beheld Abraham Lincoln expounding
from the stump to the farmers of Illinois, in 1858,
the doctrines laid down by himself in 1819 and
1821.</p>

<p>Briefly stated, the facts in the case of Cohens <i>vs.</i>
Virginia were as follows: The City of Washington
was incorporated under an act of Congress<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> which,
among other things, empowered the corporation to
"authorize the drawing of lotteries for effecting any
important improvements in the city which the ordinary
funds or revenue thereof will not accomplish,"
to an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars, the
object first to be approved by the President.<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> Accordingly
a city ordinance was passed, creating "The
National Lottery" and authorizing it to sell tickets
and conduct drawings.</p>

<p>By an act of the Virginia Legislature<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> the purchase
or sale within the State of lottery tickets, except
those of lotteries authorized by the laws of
Virginia, was forbidden under penalty of a fine of one
hundred dollars for each offense.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>On June 1, 1820, "P. J. &amp; M. J. Cohen, ... being
evil-disposed persons," violated the Virginia statute
by selling to one William H. Jennings in the Borough
of Norfolk two half and four quarter lottery tickets
"of the National Lottery, to be drawn in the city
of Washington, that being a lottery not authorized
by the laws of this commonwealth," as the information
of James Nimmo, the prosecuting attorney,
declared.<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a></p>

<p>At the quarterly session of the Court of Norfolk,
held September 2, 1820, the case came on for hearing
before the Mayor, Recorder, and Aldermen of said
borough and was decided upon an agreed case "in
lieu of a special verdict," which set forth the sale
of the lottery tickets, the Virginia statute, the act of
Congress incorporating the City of Washington, and
the fact that the National Lottery had been established
under that act.<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> The Norfolk Court found the
defendants guilty and fined them in the sum of one
hundred dollars. This paltry amount could not have
paid one twentieth part of the fees which the eminent
counsel who appeared for the Cohens would, ordinarily,
have charged.<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> The case was carried to the
Supreme Court on a writ of error.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>On behalf of Virginia, Senator James Barbour of
that State<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> moved that the writ of error be dismissed,
and upon this motion the main arguments were made
and Marshall's principal opinion delivered. In concluding
his argument, Senator Barbour came near
threatening secession, as he had done in the Senate:
"Nothing can so much endanger it [the National
Government] as exciting the hostility of the state
governments. With them it is to determine how long
this government shall endure."<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a></p>

<p>In opening for the Cohens, David B. Ogden of
New York denied that "there is any such thing as
a sovereign state, independent of the Union." The
authority of the Supreme Court "extends ... to all
cases arising under the constitution, laws, and treaties
of the United States."<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> Cohens <i>vs.</i> Virginia was such
a case.</p>

<p>Upon the supremacy of the Supreme Court over
State tribunals depended the very life of the Nation,
declared William Pinkney, who appeared as the principal
counsel for the Cohens. Give up the appellate
jurisdiction of National courts "from the decisions
of the state tribunals" and "every other branch of
federal authority might as well be surrendered. To
part with this, leaves the Union a mere league or
confederacy."<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> Long, brilliantly, convincingly, did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
Pinkney speak. The extreme State Rights arguments
were, he asserted, "too wild and extravagant"<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a>
to deserve consideration.</p>

<p>Promptly Marshall delivered the opinion of the
court on Barbour's motion to dismiss the writ of
error. The points made against the jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court were, he said: "1st. That a state
is a defendant. 2d. That no writ of error lies from
this court to a state court. 3d. ... that this court ...
has no right to review the judgment of the state
court, because neither the constitution nor any law
of the United States has been violated by that
judgment."<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a></p>

<p>The first two points "vitally ... affect the Union,"
declared the Chief Justice, who proceeds to answer
the reasoning of the State judges when, in Hunter <i>vs.</i>
Fairfax's Devisee, they hurled at the Supreme Court
Virginia's defiance of National authority.<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> Marshall
thus states the Virginia contentions: That the Constitution
has "provided no tribunal for the final construction
of itself, or of the laws or treaties of the
nation; but that this power may be exercised ... by the
courts of every state of the Union. That the constitution,
laws, and treaties, may receive as many
constructions as there are states; and that this is not
a mischief, or, if a mischief, is irremediable."<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a></p>

<p>Why was the Constitution established? Because
the "American States, as well as the American people,
have believed a close and firm Union to be essential
to their liberty and to their happiness. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
have been taught by experience, that this Union
cannot exist without a government for the whole;
and they have been taught by the same experience
that this government would be a mere shadow, that
must disappoint all their hopes, unless invested with
large portions of that sovereignty which belongs to
independent states."<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a></p>

<p>The very nature of the National Government
leaves no doubt of its supremacy "in all cases where
it is empowered to act"; that supremacy was also
expressly declared in the Constitution itself, which
plainly states that it, and laws and treaties made
under it, "'shall be the supreme law of the land; and
the judges in every state shall be bound thereby;
anything in the constitution or laws of any state to
the contrary notwithstanding.'"</p>

<p>This supremacy of the National Government is a
Constitutional "principle." And why were "ample
powers" given to that Government? The Constitution
answers: "In order to form a more perfect
union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquillity,
provide for the common defense, promote the general
welfare."<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a></p>

<p>The "limitations on the sovereignty of the states"
were made for the same reason that the "supreme
government" of the Nation was endowed with its
broad powers. In addition to express limitations on
State "sovereignty" were many instances "where,
perhaps, <i>no other power is conferred on Congress than
a conservative power to maintain the principles</i> established
in the constitution. The maintenance of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
principles in their purity, is certainly among the
great duties of the government."<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a></p>

<p>Marshall had been Chief Justice of the United
States for twenty years, and these were the boldest
and most extreme words that he had spoken during
that period. Like all men of the first rank, Marshall
met in a great way, and without attempt at
compromise, a great issue that could not be compromised&mdash;an
issue which, everywhere, at that
moment, was challenging the existence of the Nation.
There must be no dodging, no hedging, no
equivocation. Instead, there must be the broadest,
frankest, bravest declaration of National powers that
words could express. For this reason Marshall said
that these powers might be exercised even as a result
of "a conservative power" in Congress "to maintain
the principles established in the constitution."</p>

<p>The Judicial Department is an agency essential
to the performance of the "great duty" to preserve
those "principles." "It is authorized to decide all
cases of every description, arising under the constitution
or laws of the United States." Those cases
in which a State is a party are not excepted. There
are cases where the National courts are given jurisdiction
solely because a State is a party, and regardless
of the subject of the controversy; but in
all cases involving the Constitution, laws, or treaties
of the Nation, the National tribunals have jurisdiction,
regardless of parties.<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a></p>

<p>"Principles" drawn from the very "<i>nature of
government</i>" require that "the judicial power ...<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
must be co-extensive with the legislative, and must
be capable of deciding every judicial question which
grows out of the constitution and laws"&mdash;not that
"it is fit that it should be so; but ... that this fitness"
is an aid to the right interpretation of the
Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a></p>

<p>What will be the result if Virginia's attitude is
confirmed? Nothing less than the prostration of the
National Government "at the feet of every state in
the Union.... Each member will possess a veto on
the will of the whole." Consider the country's experience.
Assumption<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> had been deemed unconstitutional
by some States; opposition to excise
taxes had produced the Whiskey Rebellion;<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> other
National statutes "have been questioned partially,
while they were supported by the great majority of
the American people."<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> There can be no assurance
that such divergent and antagonistic actions may
not again be taken. State laws in conflict with National
laws probably will be enforced by State
judges, since they are subject to the same prejudices
as are the State Legislatures&mdash;indeed, "in many
states the judges are dependent for office and for
salary on the will of the legislature."<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a></p>

<p>The Constitution attaches first importance to the
"independence" of the Judiciary; can it have been
intended to leave to State "tribunals, where this independence
may not exist," cases in which "a state
shall prosecute an individual who claims the protection
of an act of Congress?" Marshall gives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
examples of possible collisions between National
and State authority, in ordinary times, as well as in
exceptional periods.<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> Even to-day it is obvious that
the Chief Justice was denouncing the threatened
resistance by State officials to the tariff laws, a
fact of commanding importance at the time when
Marshall's opinion in Cohens <i>vs.</i> Virginia was delivered.</p>

<p>At this point he rises to the heights of august eloquence:
"A constitution is framed for ages to come,
and is designed to approach immortality as nearly
as human institutions can approach it. Its course
cannot always be tranquil. It is exposed to storms
and tempests, and its framers must be unwise statesmen
indeed, if they have not provided it ... with the
means of self-preservation from the perils it may be
destined to encounter. No government ought to be
so defective in its organization as not to contain
within itself the means of securing the execution of
its own laws against other dangers than those which
occur every day."</p>

<p>Marshall is here replying to the Southern threats
of secession, just as he rebuked the same spirit when
displayed by his New England friends ten years
earlier.<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> Then turning to the conflict of courts, he
remarks, as though the judicial collision is all that
he has in mind: "A government should repose on
its own courts, rather than on others."<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a></p>

<p>He recalls the state of the country under the
Confederation when requisitions on the States were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
"habitually disregarded," although they were "as
constitutionally obligatory as the laws enacted by
the present Congress." In view of this fact is it improbable
that the framers of the Constitution meant
to give the Nation's courts the power of preserving
that Constitution, and laws made in pursuance of
it, "from all violation from every quarter, so far as
judicial decisions can preserve them"?<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a></p>

<p>Virginia contends that if States wish to destroy
the National Government they can do so much
more simply and easily than by judicial decision&mdash;"they
have only not to elect senators, and it expires
without a struggle"; and that therefore the destructive
effect on the Nation of decisions of State
courts cannot be taken into account when construing
the Constitution.</p>

<p>To this Marshall makes answer: "Whenever hostility
to the existing system shall become universal,
it will be also irresistible. The people made the
constitution, and the people can unmake it. It is
the creature of their own will, and lives only by their
will. But this supreme and irresistible power to
make or to unmake, resides only in the whole body
of the people; not in any sub-division of them. The
attempt of any of the parts to exercise it is usurpation,
and ought to be repelled by those to whom
the people have delegated their power of repelling
it. The acknowledged inability of the government,
then, to sustain itself against the public will, and,
by force or otherwise, to control the whole nation,
is no sound argument in support of its constitutional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
inability to preserve itself against a section of the
nation acting in opposition to the general will."<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a></p>

<p>This is a direct reply to the Southern arguments
in the Missouri debate which secessionists were now
using wherever those who opposed National laws
and authority raised their voices. John Marshall is
blazing the way for Abraham Lincoln. He speaks
of a "section" instead of a State. The Nation, he
says, may constitutionally preserve itself "against
a section." And this right of the Nation rests on
"principles" inherent in the Constitution. But in
Cohens <i>vs.</i> Virginia no "section" was arrayed
against the Nation&mdash;on the record there was nothing
but a conflict of jurisdiction of courts, and this
only by a strained construction of a municipal lottery
ordinance into a National law.</p>

<p>The Chief Justice is exerting to the utmost his tremendous
powers, not to protect two furtive peddlers
of lottery tickets, but to check a powerful movement
that, if not arrested, must destroy the Republic.
Should that movement go forward thereafter,
it must do so over every Constitutional obstacle
which the Supreme Court of the Nation could throw
in its way. In Cohens <i>vs.</i> Virginia, John Marshall
stamped upon the brow of Localism the brand of illegality.
If this is not the true interpretation of his
opinion in that case, all of the exalted language he
used is mere verbiage.</p>

<p>Marshall dwells on "the subordination of the
parts to the whole." The one great motive for establishing
the National Judiciary "was the pres<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>ervation
of the constitution and laws of the United
States, so far as they can be preserved by judicial
authority."<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a></p>

<p>Returning to the technical aspects of the controversy,
Marshall points out that the Supreme Court
plainly has appellate jurisdiction of the Cohens
case: "If a state be a party, the jurisdiction of this
court is original; if the case arise under a [National]
constitution or a [National] law, the jurisdiction is
appellate. But a case to which a state is a party
may arise under the constitution or a law of the
United States."<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> That would mean a double jurisdiction.
Marshall, therefore, shows, at provoking
length,<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> that the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court "in all cases arising under the constitution,
laws, or treaties of the United States, was not
arrested by the circumstance that a state was a
party";<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> and in this way he explains that part of
his opinion in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison, in which he
reasoned that Section 13 of the Ellsworth Judiciary
Act was unconstitutional.<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a></p>

<p>Marshall examines the Eleventh Amendment
and becomes, for a moment, the historian, a r&ocirc;le in
which he delighted. "The states were greatly indebted"
at the close of the Revolution; the Constitution
was opposed because it was feared that
their obligations would be collected in the National
courts. This very thing happened. "The alarm
was general; and, to quiet the apprehensions that
were so extensively entertained, this amendment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
was ... adopted." But "its motive was not to maintain
the sovereignty of a state from the degradation
supposed to attend a compulsory appearance
before the tribunal of the nation." It was to prevent
creditors from suing a State&mdash;"no interest could be
felt in so changing the relations between the whole and
its parts, as to strip the government of the means
of protecting, by the instrumentality of its courts,
the constitution and laws from active violation."<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a></p>

<p>With savage relish the Chief Justice attacks and
demolishes the State Rights theory that the Supreme
Court cannot review the judgment of a
State court "in any case." That theory, he says,
"considers the federal judiciary as completely foreign
to that of a state; and as being no more connected
with it, in any respect whatever, than the
court of a foreign state."<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> But "the United States
form, for many, and for most important purposes, a
single nation.... In war, we are one people. In making
peace, we are one people. In all commercial
regulations, we are one and the same people. In
many other respects, the American people are one;
and the government which is alone capable of controlling
and managing their interests in all these
respects, is the government of the Union.</p>

<p>"It is their government, and in that character
they have no other. America has chosen to be, in
many respects, and to many purposes, a nation; and
for all these purposes, her government is complete;
to all these objects, it is competent. The people
have declared, that in the exercise of all powers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
given for these objects it is supreme. It can, then,
in effecting these objects, legitimately control all
individuals or governments within the American
territory. The Constitution and laws of a state, so
far as they are repugnant to the Constitution and
laws of the United States, are absolutely void.</p>

<p>"These states are constituent parts of the United
States. They are members of one great empire."<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a>
The National Court alone can decide all questions
arising under the Constitution and laws of the Nation.
"The uniform decisions of this court on the
point now under consideration," he continues, "have
been assented to, with a single exception,<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> by the
courts of every state in the Union whose judgments
have been revised."<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a></p>

<p>As to the lottery ordinance of the City of Washington,
Congress has exclusive power to legislate
for the District of Columbia and, in exercising that
power, acts "as the legislature of the Union." The
Constitution declares that it, and all laws made
under it, constitute "the supreme law of the land."<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a>
Laws for the government of Washington are, therefore,
parts of this "supreme law" and "bind the
nation.... Congress legislates, in the same forms,
and in the same character, in virtue of powers of
equal obligation, conferred in the same instrument,
when exercising its exclusive powers of legislation,
as well as when exercising those which are limited."<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a></p>

<p>The Chief Justice gives examples of the exclusive
powers of Congress, all of which are binding through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>out
the Republic. "Congress is not a local legislature,
but exercises this particular power [to legislate
for the District of Columbia], like all its other
powers, in its high character, as the legislature of
the Union."<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> The punishment of the Cohens for
selling tickets of the National Lottery, created by
the City of Washington under authority of an act
of Congress, involves the construction of the Constitution
and of a National law. The Supreme Court,
therefore, has jurisdiction of the case, and the motion
to dismiss the writ of error is denied.</p>

<p>Marshall having thus established the jurisdiction
of the Supreme Court to hear and decide the case,
it was argued "on the merits." Again David B.
Ogden appeared for the Cohens and was joined by
William Wirt as Attorney-General. For Virginia
Webster took the place of Senator Barbour. The
argument was upon the true construction of the act
of Congress authorizing the City of Washington to
establish a lottery; and upon this Marshall delivered
a second opinion, to the effect that the lottery
ordinance was "only co-extensive with the city"
and a purely local affair; that the court at Norfolk
had a right to fine the Cohens for violating a law
of Virginia; and that its judgment must be affirmed.<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a></p>

<p>So ended, as far as the formal record goes, the
famous case of Cohens <i>vs.</i> Virginia. On its merits it
amounted to nothing; the practical result of the
appeal was nothing; but it afforded John Marshall
the opportunity to tell the Nation its duty in a
crowning National emergency.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>Intense was the excitement and violent the rage
in the anti-Nationalist camp when Marshall's opinion
was published. Ritchie, in his paper, demanded
that the Supreme Court should be abolished.<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> The
Virginia Republican organization struck instantly,
Spencer Roane wielding its sword. The <i>Enquirer</i>
published a series of five articles between May 25
and June 8, 1821, inclusive, signed "Algernon Sidney,"
Roane's latest <i>nom de plume</i>.</p>

<p>"The liberties and constitution of our country
are ... deeply and vitally endangered by the fatal
effects" of Marshall's opinion. "Appointed in one
generation it [the Supreme Court] claims to make
laws and constitutions for another."<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> The unanimity
of the court can be explained only on the
ground of "a culpable apathy in the other judges,
or a confidence not to be excused, in the principles
and talents of their chief." Sidney literally wastes
reams of paper in restating the State Rights arguments.
He finds a malign satisfaction in calling the
Constitution a "compact," a "league," a "treaty"
between "sovereign governments."<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a></p>

<p>National judges have "<i>no</i> interest in the government
or laws of any state but that of which they are
citizens," asserts Sidney. "As to every other state
but that, they are, completely, aliens and foreigners."<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a>
Virginia is as much a foreign nation as Russia<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a>
so far as jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
the judgments of State courts is concerned. Marshall's
doctrine "is the blind and absolute despotism
which exists in an army, or is exercised by a
tyrant over his slaves."<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a></p>

<p>The apostate Republican Justices who concurred
with Marshall are denounced, and with greater
force, by reason of a tribute paid to the hated Chief
Justice: "How else is it that they also go to all
lengths with the ultra-federal leader who is at the
head of their court? That leader is honorably distinguished
from you messieurs judges. He is true
to his former politics. He has even pushed them to
an extreme never until now anticipated. He must
be equally delighted and <i>surprised</i> to find his <i>Republican</i>
brothers going with him"&mdash;a remark as true
as it was obvious. "How is it ... that they go with
him, not only as to the results of his opinions, but
as to all the points and positions contained in the
most lengthy, artful and alarming opinions?" Because,
answers Sidney, they are on the side of power
and of "the government that feeds them."<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a></p>

<p>What Marshall had said in the Virginia Constitutional
Convention of 1788 refutes his opinions now.
"Great principles then operated on his luminous
mind, not hair-splitting quibbles and verbal criticisms."<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a>
The "artifices" of the Chief Justice render
his opinions the more dangerous.<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a></p>

<p>If the anger of John Marshall ever was more
aroused than it was by Roane's assaults upon him,
no evidence of the fact exists. Before the last number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
of the Algernon Sidney essays appeared, the Chief
Justice confides his wrathful feelings to the devoted
and sympathetic Story: "The opinion of the Supreme
Court in the Lottery case has been assaulted with
a degree of virulence transcending what has appeared
on any former occasion. Algernon Sidney
is written by the gentleman who is so much distinguished
for his feelings towards the Supreme Court,
&amp; if you have not an opportunity of seeing the Enquirer
I will send it to you.</p>

<p>"There are other minor gentry who seek to curry
favor &amp; get into office by adding their mite of abuse,
but I think for coarseness &amp; malignity of invention
Algernon Sidney surpasses all party writers
who have ever made pretensions to any decency of
character. There is on this subject no such thing
as a free press in Virginia, and of consequence the
calumnies and misrepresentations of this gentleman
will remain uncontradicted &amp; will by many be believed
to be true. He will be supposed to be the
champion of state rights, instead of being what he
really is, the champion of dismemberment."<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a></p>

<p>When Roane's articles were finished, Marshall
wrote Story: "I send you the papers containing the
essays of Algernon Sidney. Their coarseness &amp; malignity
would designate the author if he was not avowed.
The argument, if it may be called one, is, I think, as
weak as its language is violent &amp; prolix. Two other
gentlemen<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> have appeared in the papers on this sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>ject,
one of them is deeply concerned in pillaging the
purchasers of the Fairfax estate in which goodly
work he fears no other obstruction than what arises<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
from the appellate power of the Supreme Court, &amp;
the other is a hunter after office who hopes by his
violent hostility to the Union, which in Virginia assumes
the name of regard for state rights, &amp; by his
devotion to Algernon Sidney, to obtain one. In support
of the sound principles of the constitution &amp; of
the Union of the States, not a pen is drawn. In Virginia
the tendency of things verges rapidly to the
destruction of the government &amp; the re-establishment
of a league of sovereign states. I look elsewhere
for safety."<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a></p>

<p>Another of the "minor gentry" of whom Marshall
complained was William C. Jarvis, who in 1820 had
written a book entitled "The Republicans," in which
he joined in the hue and cry against Marshall because
of his opinion in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland.
Jarvis sent a copy of his book to Jefferson who, in
acknowledging the receipt of it, once more spoke
his mind upon the National Judiciary. To Jarvis's
statement that the courts are "the ultimate arbiters
of all constitutional questions," Jefferson objected.</p>

<p>It was "a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one
which would place us under the despotism of an
oligarchy," wrote the "Sage of Monticello." "The
constitution has erected no such single tribunal,
knowing that to whatever hands confided, with the
corruptions of time and party, its members would
become despots.... If the legislature fails to pass"
necessary laws&mdash;such as those for taking of the
census, or the payment of judges; or even if "they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
fail to meet in congress, the judges cannot issue their
mandamus to them."</p>

<p>So, concludes Jefferson, if the President does not
appoint officers to fill vacancies, "the judges cannot
force him." In fact, the judges "can issue their
mandamus ... to no executive or legislative officer
to enforce the fulfilment of their official duties, any
more than the president or legislature may issue
orders to the judges.... When the legislature or executive
functionaries act unconstitutionally, they
are responsible to the people in their elective
capacity. The exemption of the judges from that is
quite dangerous enough."<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a></p>

<p>This letter by Jefferson had just been made public,
and Story, who appears to have read everything
from the Greek classics to the current newspaper
gossip, at once wrote Marshall. The Chief Justice
replied that Jefferson's view "rather grieves than
surprizes" him. But he could not "describe the
surprize &amp; mortification" he felt when he learned
that Madison agreed with Jefferson "with respect
to the judicial department. For M<sup>r</sup> Jefferson's
opinion as respects this department it is not difficult
to assign the cause. He is among the most ambitious,
&amp; I suspect among the most unforgiving of men.
His great power is over the mass of the people, &amp;
this power is chiefly acquired by professions of democracy.
Every check on the wild impulse of the
moment is a check on his own power, &amp; he is unfriendly
to the source from which it flows. He looks
of course with ill will at an independent judiciary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p>"That in a free country with a written constitution
any intelligent man should wish a dependent
judiciary, or should think that the constitution is
not a law for the court as well as for the legislature
would astonish me, if I had not learnt from observation
that with many men the judgement is completely
controuled by the passions."<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a></p>

<p>To Jefferson, Marshall ascribes Roane's attacks
upon the Supreme Court: "There is some reason to
believe that the essays written against the Supreme
Court were, in a degree at least, stimulated by this
gentleman, and that although the coarseness of the
language belongs exclusively to the author, its acerbity
has been increased by his communications with
the great Lama of the mountains. He may therefore
feel himself ... required to obtain its republication
in some place of distinction."<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a></p>

<p>John E. Hall was at that time the publisher at Philadelphia
of <i>The Journal of American Jurisprudence</i>.
Jefferson had asked Hall to reprint Roane's articles,
and Hall had told Story, who faithfully reported to
Marshall. "I am a little surprized at the request
which you say has been made to M<sup>r</sup> Hall, although
there is no reason for my being so. The settled
hostility of the gentleman who has made that request
to the judicial department will show itself in that &amp;
in every other form which he believes will conduce to
its object. For this he has several motives, &amp; it is not
among the weakest that the department would never
lend itself as a tool to work for his political power....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>"What does M<sup>r</sup> Hall purpose to do?" asks Marshall.
"I do not suppose you would willingly interfere
so as to prevent his making the publication, although
I really think it is in form &amp; substance totally
unfit to be placed in his law journal. I really think
a proper reply to the request would be to say that
no objection existed to the publication of any law
argument against the opinion of the Supreme Court,
but that the coarseness of its language, its personal
&amp; official abuse &amp; its tedious prolixity constituted
objections to the insertion of Algernon Sidney which
were insuperable. If, however, M<sup>r</sup> Hall determines
to comply with this request, I think he ought, unless
he means to make himself a party militant, to say
that he published that piece by particular request,
&amp; ought to subjoin the masterly answer of M<sup>r</sup>
Wheaton. I shall wish to know what course M<sup>r</sup> Hall
will pursue."<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a></p>

<p>Roane's attacks on Marshall did not appear in
Hall's law magazine!</p>

<p>Quitting such small, unworthy, and prideful considerations,
Marshall rises for a moment to the great
issue which he met so nobly in his opinions in
M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland and in Cohens <i>vs.</i> Virginia.
"A deep design," he writes Story, "to convert our
government into a mere league of states has taken
strong hold of a powerful &amp; violent party in Virginia.
The attack upon the judiciary is in fact an attack
upon the union. The judicial department is well
understood to be that through which the govern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>ment
may be attacked most successfully, because it
is without patronage, &amp; of course without power.
And it is equally well understood that every subtraction
from its jurisdiction is a vital wound to
the government itself. The attack upon it therefore
is a masked battery aimed at the government
itself.</p>

<p>"The whole attack, if not originating with M<sup>r</sup>
Jefferson, is obviously approved &amp; guided by him.
It is therefore formidable in other states as well as
in this, &amp; it behoves the friends of the union to be
more on the alert than they have been. An effort will
certainly be made to repeal the 25<sup>th</sup> sec. of the
judicial act."<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> Marshall's indignation at Roane
exhausted his limited vocabulary of resentment.
Had he possessed Jefferson's resources of vituperation,
the literature of animosity would have been
enriched by the language Marshall would have indulged
in when the next Republican battery poured
its volleys upon him.</p>

<p>No sooner had Roane's artillery ceased to play
upon Marshall and the Supreme Court than the
roar of Taylor's heavy guns was again heard. In
a powerful and brilliant book, called "Tyranny
Unmasked," he directed his fire upon the newly proposed
protective tariff, "this sport for capitalists
and death for the rest of the nation."<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> The theory
of the Chief Justice that there is a "supreme federal
power" over the States is proved false by the proceedings
of the Constitutional Convention at Phila<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>delphia
in 1787. Certain members then proposed to
give the National Government a veto over the acts
of State Governments.<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> This proposal was immediately
rejected. Yet to-day Marshall proclaims
a National power, "infinitely more objectionable,"
which asserts that the Supreme Court has "a negative
or restraining power over the State governments."<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a></p>

<p>A protective tariff is only another monstrous child
of Marshall's accursed Nationalism, that prolific
mother of special favors for the few. By what reasoning
is a protective tariff made Constitutional? By
the casuistry of John Marshall, that "present fashionable
mode of construction, which considers the
constitution as a lump of fine gold, a small portion
of which is so malleable as to cover the whole mass.
By this golden rule for manufacturing the constitution,
a particular power given to the Federal Government
may be made to cover all the rights reserved
to the people and the States;<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> a limited jurisdiction
given to the Federal Courts is made to cover all the
State Courts;<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> and a legislative power over ten miles
square is malleated over the whole of the United
States,<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> as a single guinea may be beaten out so as
to cover a whole house."<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> Such is the method by
which a protective tariff is made Constitutional.</p>

<p>For one hundred and twenty-one scintillant and
learned pages Taylor attacks this latest creation of
National "tyranny." The whole Nationalist system<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
is "tyranny," which it is his privilege to "unmask,"
and the duty of all true Americans to destroy.<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> Marshall's
Constitutional doctrine "amounts to the insertion
of the following article in the constitution:
'Congress shall have power, with the assent of the
Supreme Court, to exercise or usurp, and to prohibit
the States from exercising, any or all of the
powers reserved to the States, whenever they [Congress]
shall deem it convenient, or for the general
welfare.'"<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> Such doctrines invite "civil war."<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a></p>

<p>By Marshall's philosophy "the people are made
the prey of exclusive privileges." In short, under
him the Supreme Court has become the agent of
special interests.<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> "Cannot the Union subsist unless
Congress and the Supreme Court shall make banks
and lotteries?"<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson eagerly read Roane's essays and Taylor's
book and wrote concerning them: "The judiciary
branch is the instrument which, working like gravity,
without intermission, is to press us at last into
one consolidated mass. Against this I know no one
who, equally with Judge Roane himself, possesses
the power and the courage to make resistance; and
to him I look, and have long looked, as our strongest
bulwark."</p>

<p>At this point Jefferson declares for armed resistance
to the Nation in even stronger terms than those
used by Roane or Taylor: "If Congress fails to
shield the States from dangers so palpable and so im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>minent,
the States must shield themselves, and meet
the invader foot to foot.... This is already half done
by Colonel Taylor's book" which "is the most effectual
retraction of our government to its original principles
which has ever yet been sent by heaven to our
aid. Every State in the Union should give a copy to
every member they elect, as a standing instruction,
and ours should set the example."<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a></p>

<p>Until his death the aged politician raged continuously,
except in one instance,<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> at Marshall and the
Supreme Court because of such opinions and decisions
as those in the Bank and Lottery cases. He
writes Justice Johnson that he "considered ... maturely"
Roane's attacks on the doctrines of Cohens
<i>vs.</i> Virginia and they appeared to him "to pulverize
every word which had been delivered by Judge Marshall,
of the extra-judicial part of his opinion." If
Roane "can be answered, I surrender human reason
as a vain and useless faculty, given to bewilder, and
not to guide us.... This practice of Judge Marshall,
of travelling out of his case to prescribe what the law<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
would be in a moot case not before the court, is very
irregular and censurable."<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a></p>

<p>Again Jefferson writes that, above all other officials,
those who most need restraint from usurping
legislative powers are "the judges of what is commonly
called our General Government, but what I
call our Foreign department.... A few such doctrinal
decisions, as barefaced as that of the Cohens,"
may so arouse certain powerful States as to check the
march of Nationalism. The Supreme Court "has
proved that the power of declaring what the law is,
<i>ad libitum</i>, by sapping and mining, slily and without
alarm, the foundations of the Constitution, can do
what open force would not dare to attempt."<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a></p>

<p>So it came to pass that John Marshall and the
Supreme Court became a center about which swirled
the forces of a fast-gathering storm that raged with
increasing fury until its thunders were the roar of
cannon, its lightning the flashes of battle. Broadly
speaking, slavery and free trade, State banking and
debtors' relief laws were arraigned on the side of
Localism; while slavery restriction, national banking,
a protective tariff, and security of contract were
marshaled beneath the banner of Nationalism. It
was an assemblage of forces as incongruous as human
nature itself.</p>

<p>The Republican protagonists of Localism did not
content themselves with the writing of enraged letters
or the publication of flaming articles and books.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
They were too angry thus to limit their attacks,
and they were politicians of too much experience
not to crystallize an aroused public sentiment. On
December 12, 1821, Senator Richard M. Johnson
of Kentucky, who later was honored by his party
with the Vice-Presidency, offered an amendment to
the Constitution that the Senate be given appellate
jurisdiction in all cases where the Constitution or
laws of a State were questioned and the State desired
to defend them; and in all cases "where the
judicial power of the United States shall be so construed
as to extend to any case ... arising under"
the National Constitution, laws, or treaties.<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a></p>

<p>Co&ouml;perating with Johnson in the National Senate,
Roane in Virginia, when the Legislature of that State
met, prepared amendments to the National Constitution
which, had they been adopted by the States,
would have destroyed the Supreme Court. He declares
that he takes this step "with a view to aid"
the Congressional antagonists of Nationalism and
the Supreme Court, "or rather to lead, on this important
subject." The amendments "will be copied
by another hand &amp; circulated among the members.
I would not wish to injure the great Cause, by being
known as the author. My name would damn them,
as I believe, nay hope, with the <i>Tories</i>." Roane
asks his correspondent to "jog your Chesterfield
Delegates ... and other good republicans," and complains
that "Jefferson &amp; Madison hang back too
much, in this great Crisis."<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>On Monday, January 14, 1822, Senator Johnson
took the floor in support of his proposition to reduce
the power of the Supreme Court. "The conflicts between
the Federal judiciary and the sovereignty of
the States," he said, "are become so frequent and
alarming, that the public safety" demands a remedy.
"The Federal judiciary has assumed a guardianship
over the States, even to the controlling of their
peculiar municipal regulations."<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> The "basis of encroachment"
is Marshall's "doctrine of Federal supremacy ...
established by a judicial tribunal which
knows no change. Its decisions are predicated upon
the principle of perfection, and assume the character
of immutability. Like the laws of the Medes
and Persians, they live forever, and operate through
all time." What shall be done? An appeal to the
Senate "will be not only harmless, but beneficial."
It will quiet "needless alarms  ... restore ... confidence ...
preserve ... harmony." There is pressing
need to tranquillize the public mind concerning the
National Judiciary,<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> a department of the government
which is a denial of our whole democratic
theory. "Some tribunal should be established, responsible
to the people, to correct their [the Judges']
aberrations."</p>

<p>Why should not the National Judiciary be made
answerable to the people? No fair-minded man can
deny that the judges exercise legislative power. "If
a judge can repeal a law of Congress, by declaring
it unconstitutional, is not this the exercise of political
power? If he can declare the laws of a State<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
unconstitutional and void, and, in one moment, subvert
the deliberate policy of that State for twenty-four
years, as in Kentucky, affecting its whole landed
property, ... is not this the exercise of political
power? All this they have done, and no earthly
power can investigate or revoke their decisions."<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a>
The Constitution gives the National Judiciary no
such power&mdash;that instrument "is as silent as death
upon the subject."<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a></p>

<p>How absurd is the entire theory of judicial independence!
Why should not Congress as properly declare
the decisions of the National courts unconstitutional
as that the courts should do the same thing to
acts of Congress or laws of States? Think of it as a
matter of plain common sense&mdash;"forty-eight Senators,
one hundred and eighty-eight Representatives,
and the President of the United States, all sworn to
maintain the Constitution, have concurred in the
sentiment that the measure is strictly conformable
to it. Seven judges, irresponsible to any earthly
tribunal for their decisions, revise the measure, declare
it unconstitutional, and effectually destroy its
operation. Whose opinion shall prevail? that of the
legislators and President, or that of the Court?"<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a></p>

<p>The Supreme Court, too, has gently exercised the
principle of judicial supervision over acts of Congress;
has adjudged that Congress has a free hand
in choosing means to carry out powers expressly
granted to that body. But consider the conduct of
the Supreme Court toward the States: "An irresponsible
judiciary" has ruthlessly struck down State<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
law after State law; has repeatedly destroyed the decisions
of State courts. Look at Marshall's opinions
in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland, in the Dartmouth College
case, in United States <i>vs.</i> Peters, in Sturges <i>vs.</i>
Crowninshield, in Cohens <i>vs.</i> Virginia&mdash;smallest,
but perhaps worst of all, in Wilson <i>vs.</i> New Jersey.
The same principle runs through all these pronouncements;&mdash;the
States are nothing, the Nation everything.<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a></p>

<p>Webster, in the House, heard of Johnson's speech
and promptly wrote Story: "Mr. Johnson of Kentucky
... has dealt, they say, pretty freely with the
supreme court. Dartmouth College, Sturges and
Crowninshield, <i>et cetera</i>, have all been demolished.
To-morrow he is to pull to pieces the case of the
Kentucky betterment law. Then Governor [Senator]
Barber [Barbour] is to annihilate Cohens <i>v.</i> Virginia.
So things go; but I see less reality in all this smoke
than I thought I should, before I came here."<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a></p>

<p>It would have been wiser for Webster to have listened
carefully to Johnson's powerful address than to
have sneered at it on hearsay, for it was as able as it
was brave; and, erroneous though it was, it stated
most of the arguments advanced before or since
against the supervisory power of the National Judiciary
over the enactments of State Legislatures and
the decisions of State courts.</p>

<p>When the Kentucky Senator resumed his speech
the following day, he drove home his strongest
weapon&mdash;an instance of judicial interference with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
State laws which, indeed, at first glance appeared to
have been arbitrary, autocratic, and unjust. The
agreement between Virginia and Kentucky by which
the latter was separated from the parent Commonwealth
provided that "all private rights and interests
of lands" in Kentucky "derived from the laws of
Virginia, shall remain valid ... and shall be determined
by the laws now existing" in Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a></p>

<p>In 1797 the Kentucky Legislature enacted that persons
occupying lands in that State who could show a
clear and connected title could not, without notice of
any adverse title, upon eviction by the possessor of a
superior title, be held liable for rents and profits during
such occupancy.<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> Moreover, all permanent improvements
made on the land must, in case of eviction,
be deducted from the value of the land and
judgment therefor rendered in favor of the innocent
occupant and against the successful claimant. On
January 31, 1812, this "occupying claimant" law,
as it was called, was further strengthened by a statute
providing that any person "seating and improving"
lands in Kentucky, believing them "to be his
own" because of a claim founded on public record,
should be paid for such seating and improvements by
any person who thereafter was adjudged to be the
lawful owner of the lands.</p>

<p>Against one such occupant, Richard Biddle, the
heirs of a certain John Green brought suit in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
United States Court for the District of Kentucky,
and the case was certified to the Supreme Court on
a division of opinion of the judges. The case was
argued and decided at the same term at which
Marshall delivered his opinion in Cohens <i>vs.</i> Virginia.
Story delivered the unanimous opinion of the court:
that the Kentucky "occupying claimant" laws violated
the separation "compact" between Virginia
and Kentucky, because, "by the <i>general principles of
law</i>, and from the necessity of the case, titles to real
estate can be determined only by the laws of the
state under which they were acquired."<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> Unfortunately
Story did not specifically base the court's
decision on the contract clause of the Constitution,
but left this vital point to inference.</p>

<p>Henry Clay, "as <i>amicus curi&aelig;</i>," moved for a rehearing
because the rights of numerous occupants of
Kentucky lands "would be irrevocably determined
by this decision," and because Biddle had permitted
the case "to be brought to a hearing without appearing
by his counsel, and without any argument on
that side of the question."<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> In effect, Clay thus intimated
that the case was feigned. The motion was
granted and Green <i>vs.</i> Biddle was awaiting reargument
when Senator Johnson made his attack on the
National Judiciary.</p>

<p>Johnson minutely examined the historical reasons
for including the contract clause in the National
Constitution, "in order to understand perfectly well
the mystical influence" of that provision.<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> It never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
was intended to affect such legislation as the Kentucky
land system. The intent and meaning of the
contract clause is, that "you shall not declare to-day
that contract void, ... which was made yesterday
under the sanction of law."<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> Does this simple rule
of morality justify the National courts in annulling
measures of public policy "which the people have
solemnly declared to be expedient"?<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> The decision
of the Supreme Court in Green <i>vs.</i> Biddle, said
Johnson, "prostrates the deliberate" course which
Kentucky has pursued for almost a quarter of a
century, "and affects its whole landed interest.
The effect is to legislate for the people; to regulate
the interior policy of that community, and to
establish their municipal code as to real estate."<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a></p>

<p>If such judicial supremacy prevails, the courts can
"establish systems of policy by judicial decision."
What is this but despotism? "I see no difference,
whether you take this power from the people and
give it to your judges, who are in office for life, or
grant it to a King for life."<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a></p>

<p>The time is overripe, asserts Johnson, to check
judicial usurpation&mdash;already the National Judiciary
has struck down laws of eight States.<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> The
career of this judicial oligarchy must be ended. "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
security of our liberties demands it." Let the jurisdiction
of National courts be specifically limited; or
let National judges be subject to removal upon address
of both Houses of Congress; or let their commissions
be vacated "after a limited term of service";
or, finally, "vest a controlling power in the Senate ...
or some other body who shall be responsible to the
elective franchise."<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a></p>

<p>The Kentucky Legislature backed its fearless
Senator;<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> but the Virginia Assembly weakened at
the end. Most of the Kentucky land titles, which the
Supreme Court's decision had protected as against
the "occupying claimants," were, of course, held
by Virginians or their assignees. Virginia conservatives,
too, were beginning to realize the wisdom of
Marshall's Nationalist policy as it affected all their
interests, except slavery and tariff taxation; and
these men were becoming hesitant about further
attacks on the Supreme Court. Doubtless, also,
Marshall's friends were active among the members
of the Legislature. Roane understood the situation
when he begged friends to "jog up" the apathetic,
and bemoaned the quiescence of Jefferson and Madison.
His proposed amendments were lost, though
by a very close vote.<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Virginia Localists carried the
fight to the floors of Congress. On April 26, 1822,
Andrew Stevenson, one of Roane's lieutenants and
now a member of the National House, demanded the
repeal of Section 25 of the Ellsworth Judiciary Act
which gave the Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction
over the State courts. But Stevenson was unwontedly
mild. He offered his resolution "in a spirit
of peace and forbearance.... It was ... due to those
States, in which the subject has been lately so much
agitated, as well as to the nation, to have it ...
decided."<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a></p>

<p>As soon as Congress convened in the winter of
1823, Senator Johnson renewed the combat; but he
had become feeble, even apologetic. He did not
mean to reflect "upon the conduct of the judges, for
he believed them to be highly enlightened and intelligent."
Nevertheless, their life tenure and irresponsibility
required that some limit should be fixed to
their powers. So he proposed that the membership
of the Supreme Court be increased to ten, and that
at least seven Justices should concur in any opinion
involving the validity of National or State laws.<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

<p>Four months later, Senator Martin Van Buren reported
from the Judiciary Committee, a bill "that
no law of any of the States shall be rendered invalid,
without the concurrence of at least five Judges of the
Supreme Court; their opinions to be separately expressed."<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a>
But the friends of the Judiciary easily
overcame the innovators; the bill was laid on the
table;<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> and for that session the assault on the Supreme
Court was checked. At the next session,
however, Kentucky again brought the matter before
Congress. Charles A. Wickliffe, a Representative
from that State, proposed that writs of error from
the Supreme Court be "awarded to either party,"
regardless of the decision of the Supreme Court of
any State.<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> Webster, on the Judiciary Committee,
killed Wickliffe's resolution with hardly a wave of
his hand.<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a></p>

<p>After a reargument of Green <i>vs</i>. Biddle, lasting an
entire week,<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> the Supreme Court stood to its guns
and again held the Kentucky land laws unconstitutional.
Yet so grave was the crisis that the
decision was not handed down for a whole year.
This time the opinion of the court was delivered on
February 27, 1823, by Bushrod Washington, who
held that the contract clause of the National Constitution
was violated, but plainly considered that
"the principles of law and reason"<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> were of more
importance in this case than the Constitutional pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>vision.
Washington's opinion displays the alarm of
the Supreme Court at the assaults upon it: "We
hold ourselves answerable to God, our consciences
and our country, to decide this question according
to the dictates of our best judgment, be the consequences
of the decision what they may."<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a></p>

<p>Kentucky promptly replied. In his Message to
the Legislature, Governor John Adair declared that
the Kentucky decisions of the Supreme Court struck
at "the right of the people to govern themselves."
The National authority can undoubtedly employ
force to "put down insurrection," but "that ... day,
when the government shall be compelled to resort
to the bayonet to compel a state to submit to its
laws, will not long precede an event of all others to
be deprecated."<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a></p>

<p>One of Marshall's numerous Kentucky kinsmen,
who was an active member of the Legislature,
stoutly protested against any attack on the Supreme
Court; nevertheless he offered a resolution reciting
the grievances of the State and proposing an address
"to the supreme court of the United States,
in full session," against the decision and praying for
"its total and definitive reversal."<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> What! exclaimed
John Rowan, another member of the Legislature,
shall Kentucky again petition "like a degraded prov<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>ince

that the Legislature "do ... most solemnly PROTEST

Biddle."<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a> When modified, Rowan's resolutions,
one of which hinted at forcible resistance to the
mandate of the Supreme Court, passed by heavy
majorities.<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> Later resolutions openly threatened to
"call forth the physical power of the state, to resist
the execution of the decisions of the court," which
were "considered erroneous and unconstitutional."<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a></p>

<p>In the same year that the Supreme Court decided
the Kentucky land case, Justice Johnson aroused
South Carolina by a decision rendered in the United
States District Court of that State. One Henry
Elkison, a negro sailor and a British subject, was
taken by the sheriff of the Charleston district, from
the British ship Homer; and imprisoned under a
South Carolina law which directed the arrest and
confinement of any free negro on board any ship
entering the ports of that State, the negro to be
released only when the vessel departed.<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> Johnson
wrathfully declared that the "unconstitutionality
of the law ... will not bear argument"&mdash;nobody
denied that it could not be executed "without
clashing with the general powers of the United
States, to regulate commerce." Thereupon, one of
the counsel for the State said that the statute must
and would be enforced; and "that if a dissolution [<i>sic</i>]
of the union must be the alternative he was ready<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
to meet it"&mdash;an assertion which angered Johnson
who delivered an opinion almost as strong in its
Nationalism as those of Marshall.<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a></p>

<p>Throughout South Carolina and other slaveholding
States, the action of Justice Johnson inflamed
the passions of the white population. "A high state
of excitement exists," chronicles Niles.<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> Marshall,
of course, heard of the outcry against his associate
and promptly wrote Story: "Our brother Johnson, I
perceive, has hung himself on a democratic snag in
a hedge composed entirely of thorny state rights in
South Carolina.... You ... could scarcely have supposed
that it [Johnson's opinion] would have excited
so much irritation as it seems to have produced.
The subject is one of much feeling in the South....
The decision has been considered as another act
of judicial usurpation; but the sentiment has been
avowed that if this be the constitution, it is better to
break that instrument than submit to the principle....
Fuel is continually adding to the fire at which
<i>exalt&eacute;es</i> are about to roast the judicial department."<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a></p>

<p>The Governor and Legislature of South Carolina
fiercely maintained the law of the State&mdash;it was to
them a matter of "self-preservation." Niles was
distressingly alarmed. He thought that the collision
of South Carolina with the National Judiciary
threatened to disturb the harmony of the Republic
as much as the Missouri question had done.<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>

<p>This, then, was the situation when the Ohio Bank
case reached the Supreme Court.<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> Seven States were
formally in revolt against the National Judiciary,
and others were hostile. Moreover, the protective
Tariff of 1824 was under debate in Congress; its
passage was certain, while in the South ever-growing
bitterness was manifesting itself toward this plundering
device of Nationalism as John Taylor branded
it. In the House Southern members gave warning
that the law might be forcibly resisted.<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> The first
hints of Nullification were heard. Time and again
Marshall's Nationalist construction of the Constitution
was condemned. To the application of his theory
of government was laid most of the abuses of
which the South complained; most of the dangers
the South apprehended.</p>

<p>Thus again stands out the alliance of the various
forces of Localism&mdash;slavery, State banking, debtors'
relief laws, opposition to protective tariffs&mdash;which
confronted the Supreme Court with threats
of physical resistance to its decrees and with the
ability to carry out those threats.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>

<p>Two arguments were had in Osborn <i>vs.</i> The Bank
of the United States, the first by Charles Hammond
and by Henry Clay for the Bank;<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> the second by
John C. Wright, Governor Ethan Allen Brown, and
Robert Goodloe Harper, for Ohio, and by Clay,
Webster, and John Sergeant for the Bank. Arguments
on both sides were notable, but little was
presented that was new. Counsel for Ohio insisted
that the court had no jurisdiction, since the State
was the real party against which the proceedings in
the United States Court in Ohio were had. Clay
made the point that the Ohio tax, unlike that of
Maryland, "was a confiscation, and not a tax....
Is it possible," he asked, "that ... the law of the
whole may be defeated ... by a single part?"<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a></p>

<p>On March 19, 1824, Marshall delivered the opinion
of the court. All well-organized governments, he
begins, "must possess, within themselves, the means
of expounding, as well as enforcing, their own
laws." The makers of the Constitution kept constantly
in view this great political principle. The
Judiciary Article "enables the judicial department
to receive jurisdiction to the full extent of the constitution,
laws, and treaties of the United States....
That power is capable of acting only when the subject
is submitted to it by a party who asserts his
rights in the form prescribed by law. It then becomes
a case" over which the Constitution gives
jurisdiction to the National courts. "The suit of
The Bank of the United States <i>v.</i> Osborn <i>et al.</i>, is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
case, and the question is, whether it arises under a
law of the United States."<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a></p>

<p>The fact that other questions are involved does
not "withdraw a case" from the jurisdiction of the
National courts; otherwise, "almost every case, although
involving the construction of a [National] law,
would be withdrawn; and a clause in the constitution,
relating to a subject of vital importance to the government
and expressed in the most comprehensive
terms, would be construed to mean almost nothing."</p>

<p>It is true that the Constitution specifies the cases
in which the Supreme Court shall have original
jurisdiction, but nowhere in the Constitution is
there any "prohibition" against Congress giving
the inferior National courts original jurisdiction;
such a restriction is not "insinuated." Congress,
then, can give the National Circuit Courts "original
jurisdiction, in any case to which the appellate jurisdiction
[of the Supreme Court] extends."<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a></p>

<p>At this particular period of our history this was,
indeed, a tremendous expansion of the power of
Congress and the National Judiciary. Marshall
flatly declares that Congress can invest the inferior
National courts with any jurisdiction whatsoever
which the Constitution does not prohibit. It marks
another stage in the development of his Constitutional
principle that the National Government not
only has all powers expressly granted, but also all
powers not expressly prohibited. For that is just
what Marshall's reasoning amounts to during these
crucial years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>No matter, continues the Chief Justice, how
many questions, other than that affecting the
Constitution or laws, are involved in a case; if
any National question "forms an ingredient of the
original cause," Congress can "give the circuit
courts jurisdiction of that cause." The Ohio Bank
case "is of this description." All the Bank's powers,
functions, and duties are conferred or imposed by
its charter, and "that charter is a law of the United
States.... Can a being, thus constituted, have a
case which does not arise literally, as well as substantially,
under the law?"<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a></p>

<p>If the Bank brings suits on a contract, the very
first, the "foundation" question is, "has this legal
entity a right to sue?... This depends on a law of
the United States"&mdash;a fact that can never be
waived. "Whether it be in fact relied on or not, in
the defense, it is still a part of the cause, and may be
relied on."<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> Assume, as counsel for Ohio assert, that
"the case arises on the contract"; still, "the validity
of the contract depends on a law of the United
States.... The case arises emphatically under the
law. The act of Congress is its foundation.... The
act itself is the first ingredient in the case; is its origin;
is that from which every other part arises."<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a></p>

<p>Marshall concedes that the State is directly interested
in the suit and that, if the Bank could have
done so, it ought to have made the State a party.
"But this was not in the power of the bank," because
the Eleventh Amendment exempts a State
from being sued in such a case. So the "very diffi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>cult
question" arises, "whether, in such a case, the
court may act upon the agents employed by the
state, and on the property in their hands."<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a></p>

<p>Just what will be the result if the National courts
have not this power? "A denial of jurisdiction forbids
all inquiry into the nature of the case," even of
"cases perfectly clear in themselves; ... where the
government is in the exercise of its best-established
and most essential powers." If the National courts
have no jurisdiction over the agents of a State, then
those agents, under the "authority of a [State] law
void in itself, because repugnant to the constitution,
may arrest the execution of any law in the
United States"&mdash;this they may do without any to
say them nay.<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a></p>

<p>In this fashion Marshall leads up to the serious
National problem of the hour&mdash;the disposition of
some States, revealed by threats and sometimes
carried into execution, to interfere with the officers
of the National Government in the execution of
the Nation's laws. According to the Ohio-Virginia-Kentucky
idea, those officers "can obtain no protection
from the judicial department of the government.
The carrier of the mail, the collector of the
revenue,<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> the marshal of a district, the recruiting officer,
may all be inhibited, under ruinous penalties,
from the performance of their respective duties";
and not one of them can "avail himself of the preventive
justice of the nation to protect him in the
performance of his duties."<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p>

<p>Addressing himself still more directly to those
who were flouting the authority of the Nation and
preaching resistance to it, Marshall uses stern
language. What is the real meaning of the anti-National
crusade; what the certain outcome of it?
"Each member of the Union is capable, at its will,
of attacking the nation, of arresting its progress at
every step, of acting vigorously and effectually in
the execution of its designs, while the nation stands
naked, stripped of its defensive armor, and incapable
of shielding its agent or executing its laws,
otherwise than by proceedings which are to take
place after the mischief is perpetrated, and which
must often be ineffectual, from the inability of the
agents to make compensation."</p>

<p>Once more Marshall cites the case of a State "penalty
on a revenue officer, for performing his duty,"
and in this way warns those who are demanding forcible
obstruction of National law or authority, that
they are striking at the Nation and that the tribunals
of the Nation will shield the agents and officers of the
Nation: "If the courts of the United States cannot
rightfully protect the agents who execute every law
authorized by the constitution, from the direct action
of state agents in the collecting of penalties, they cannot
rightfully protect those who execute any law."<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a></p>

<p>Here, in judicial language, was that rebuke of the
spirit of Nullification which Andrew Jackson was soon
to repeat in words that rang throughout the land and
which still quicken the pulses of Americans. What is the
great question before the court in the case of Osborn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
<i>vs.</i> The Bank of the United States; what, indeed, the
great question before the country in the controversy
between recalcitrant States and the imperiled Nation?
It is, says Marshall, "whether the constitution
of the United States has provided a tribunal
which can peacefully and rightfully protect those
who are employed in carrying into execution the laws
of the Union, from the attempts of a particular state
to resist the execution of those laws."</p>

<p>Ohio asserts that "no preventive proceedings
whatever," no action even to stay the hand of a State
agent from seizing property, no suit to recover it
from that agent, can be maintained because it is
brought "substantially against the State itself, in
violation of the 11th amendment of the constitution."
Is this true? "Is a suit, brought against an individual,
for any cause whatever, a suit against a state,
in the sense of the constitution?"<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> There are many
cases in which a State may be vitally interested, as,
for example, those involving grants of land by different
States.</p>

<p>If the mere fact that the State is "interested" in, or
affected by, a suit makes the State a party, "what
rule has the constitution given, by which this interest
is to be measured?" No rule, of course! Is
then the court to decide the <i>degree</i> of "interest"
necessary to make a State a party? Absurd! since
the court would have to examine the "whole testimony
of a cause, inquiring into, and deciding on,
the extent of a State's interest, without having a
right to exercise any jurisdiction in the case."<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<p>At last he affirms that it may be "laid down as a
rule which admits of no exception, that, in all cases
where jurisdiction depends on the party, it is the
party <i>named in the record</i>." Therefore, the Eleventh
Amendment is, "of necessity, limited to those suits
in which a state is a party <i>on the record</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> In the
Ohio Bank case, it follows that, "the state not being
a party on the record, and the court having jurisdiction
over those who are parties on the record, the
true question is, not one of jurisdiction, but whether"
the officers and agents of Ohio are "only nominal
parties" or whether "the court ought to make a decree"
against them.<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> The answer to this question
depends on the constitutionality of the Ohio tax law.
Although that exact point was decided in M'Culloch
<i>vs.</i> Maryland,<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> "a revision of that opinion has been
requested; and many considerations combine to induce
a review of it."<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a></p>

<p>Maryland and Ohio claim the right to tax the
National Bank as an "individual concern ... having
private trade and private profit for its great end and
principal object." But this is not true; the Bank is
a "public corporation, created for public and national
purposes"; the fact that it transacts "private
as well as public business" does not destroy its character
as the "great instrument by which the fiscal
operations of the government are effected."<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> Obviously
the Bank cannot live unless it can do a general
business as authorized by its charter. This being
so, the right to transact such business "is necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
to the legitimate operations of the government, and
was constitutionally and rightfully engrafted on the
institution." Indeed, the power of the Bank to engage
in general banking is "the vital part of the corporation;
it is its soul." As well say that, while the
human body must not be touched, the "vivifying
principle" which "animates" it may be destroyed,
as to say that the Bank shall not be annihilated,
but that the faculty by which it exists may be extinguished.</p>

<p>For a State, then, to tax the Bank's "faculties,
its trade and occupation, is to tax the Bank itself. To
destroy or preserve the one, is to destroy or preserve
the other."<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> The mere fact that the National Government
created this corporation does not relieve it
from "state authority"; but the "operations" of
the Bank "give its value to the currency in which
all the transactions of the government are conducted."
In short, the Bank's business is "inseparably
connected" with the "transactions" of the
Government. "Its corporate character is merely an
incident, which enables it to transact that business
more beneficially."<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a></p>

<p>The Judiciary "has no will, in any case"&mdash;no
option but to execute the law as it stands. "Judicial
power, as contradistinguished from the power of the
laws, has no existence. Courts are the mere instruments
of the law, and can will nothing." They can
exercise no "discretion," except that of "discerning
the course prescribed by law; and, when that is
discerned, it is the duty of the court to follow it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
Judicial power is never exercised for the purpose
of giving effect to the will of the judge; always for
the purpose of giving effect to the will of the legislature."<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a>
This passage, so wholly unnecessary to
the decision of the case or reasoning of the opinion,
was inserted as an answer to the charges of judicial
"arrogance" and "usurpation."</p>

<p>In conclusion, Marshall holds that the Ohio law
taxing the National Bank's branches is unconstitutional
and void; that the State is not a "party on the
record"; that Osborn, Harper, Currie, and Sullivan
are "incontestably liable for the full amount of the
money taken out of the Bank"; that this money may
be pursued, since it "remained a distinct deposit"&mdash;in
fact, was "kept untouched, in a trunk, by itself,
... to await the event of the pending suit respecting
it."<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> The judgment of the lower court that the
money must be restored to the Bank was right; but
the judgment was wrong in charging interest against
the State officers, since they "were restrained by
the authority of the Circuit Court from using "the
money, taken and held by them.<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a></p>

<p>So everybody having an immediate personal and
practical interest in that particular case was made
happy, and only the State Rights theorists were discomfited.
It was an exceedingly human situation,
such as Marshall, the politician, managed to create
in his disposition of those cases that called for his
highest judicial statesmanship. No matter how
acutely he irritated party leaders and forced upon
them unwelcome issues, Marshall contrived to sat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>isfy
the persons immediately interested in most of
the cases he decided.</p>

<p>The Chief Justice himself was a theorist&mdash;one
of the greatest theorists America has produced; but
he also had an intimate acquaintance with human
nature, and this knowledge he rightly used, in the
desperate conflicts waged by him, to leave his antagonists
disarmed of those weapons with which they
were wont to fight.</p>

<p>Seemingly Justice Johnson dissented; but, burning
with anger at South Carolina's defiance of his
action in the negro sailor case, he strengthened
Marshall's opinion in his very "dissent." This is so
conspicuously true that it may well be thought that
Marshall inspired Johnson's "disagreement" with
his six brethren of the Supreme Court. Whether
the decision was "necessary or unnecessary originally,"
begins Johnson, "a <i>state of things has now
grown up, in some of the states</i>, which renders all the
protection necessary, that the general government
can give to this bank."<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> He makes a powerful and
really stirring appeal for the Bank, but finally concludes,
on technical grounds, that the Supreme
Court has no jurisdiction.<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a></p>

<p>Immediately the fight upon the Supreme Court
was renewed in Congress. On May 3, 1824, Representative
Robert P. Letcher of Kentucky rose in the
House and proposed that the Supreme Court should
be forbidden by law to hold invalid any provision<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
of a State constitution or statute unless five out of
the seven Justices concurred, each to give his opinion
"separately and distinctly," if the court held against
the State.<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> Kentucky, said Letcher, had been deprived
of "equal rights and privileges." How? By
"<i>construction</i>.... Yes, construction! Its mighty powers
are irresistible; ... it creates new principles; ... it
destroys laws long since established; and it is daily
acquiring new strength."<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> John Forsyth of Georgia
proposed as a substitute to Letcher's resolutions
that, for the transaction of business, "a majority
of the quorum" of the Supreme Court "shall be a
majority of the whole court, including the Chief
Justice." A long and animated debate<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a> ensued
in which Clay, Webster, Randolph, and Philip P.
Barbour, among others, took part.</p>

<p>David Trimble of Kentucky declared that "no
nation ought to submit, to an umpire of minorities.<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a>...
If less than three-fourths of the States cannot
amend the Constitution, less than three-fourths of
the judges ought not to construe it"&mdash;for judicial
constructions are "explanatory amendments" by
which "the person and property of every citizen
must stand or fall."<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a></p>

<p>So strong had been the sentiment for placing some
restraint on the National Judiciary that Webster,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
astute politician and most resourceful friend of the
Supreme Court, immediately offered a resolution
that, in any cause before the Supreme Court where
the validity of a State law or Constitution is drawn
in question "on the ground of repugnancy to the
Constitution, treaties, or laws, of the United States,
no judgment shall be pronounced or rendered until
a majority of all the justices ... legally competent
to sit, ... shall concur in the opinion."<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a></p>

<p>But Marshall's opinion in Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a>
had now reached the whole country and, for the time
being, changed popular hostility to the Supreme
Court into public favor toward it. The assault in
Congress died away and Webster allowed his soothing
resolution to be forgotten. When the attack on
the National Judiciary was again renewed, the language
of its adversaries was almost apologetic.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1007_1007" id="Footnote_1007_1007"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1007_1007"><span class="label">[1007]</span></a> Marshall refers to three papers published in the <i>Enquirer</i> of May
15 and 22, and June 22, the first two signed "Somers" and the third
signed "Fletcher of Saltoun." It is impossible to discover who these
writers were. Their essays, although vicious, are so dull as not to be
worth the reading, though Jefferson thought them "luminous and
striking." (Jefferson to Johnson, June 12, 1823, <i>Works</i>: Ford, <span class="smcap">xii</span>,
252, footnote.)
</p><p>
"Somers," however, is compelled to admit the irresistible appeal of
Marshall's personality. "Superior talents and address will forever
attract the homage of inferior minds." (<i>Enquirer</i>, May 15, 1821.)
</p><p>
"The Supreme court ... have rendered the constitution the sport
of legal ingenuity.... Its meaning is locked up from the profane vulgar,
and distributed only by the high priests of the temple." (<i>Ib.</i> May
22, 1821.)
</p><p>
"Fletcher of Saltoun" is intolerably verbose: "The victories ...
of courts ... though bloodless, are generally decisive.... The progress
of the judiciary, though slow, is steady and untiring as the foot of
time."
</p><p>
The people act as though hypnotized, he laments&mdash;"the powerful
mind of the chief justice has put forth its strength, and we are quiet
as if touched by the wand of enchantment;&mdash;we fall prostrate before
his genius as though we had looked upon the dazzling brightness of the
shield of Astolfo.&mdash;Triumphant indeed has been this most powerful
effort of his extraordinary mind. His followers exult&mdash;those who
doubted, have yielded; even the faithful are found wavering, and the
unconvinced can find no opening in his armor of defense."
</p><p>
This writer points out Marshall's "abominable inconsistencies,"
but seems to be himself under the spell of the Chief Justice: "I mention
not this to the disadvantage of the distinguished individual who
has pronounced these conflicting opinions. No man can have a higher
respect for the virtues of his character, or greater admiration of the
powers of his mind."
</p><p>
Alas for the change that time works upon the human intellect!
Consider Marshall, the young man, and Marshall, the Chief Justice!
"How little did he, at that early day, contemplate the possibility
of his carrying the construction of the constitution to an extent
so far beyond even what he then renounced!" [<i>sic.</i>]
</p><p>
Thereupon "Fletcher of Saltoun" plunges into an ocean of words
concerning Hamilton's theories of government and Marshall's application
of them. He announces this essay to be the first of a series;
but, luckily for everybody, this first effort exhausted him. Apparently
he, too, fell asleep under Marshall's "wand," for nothing more came
from his drowsy pen. (<i>Ib.</i> June 22, 1821.)</p></div>

Wirt, though a Republican, asserted that "the functions to be performed
by the Supreme Court ... are among the most difficult and
perilous which are to be performed under the Constitution. They
demand the loftiest range of talents and learning and a soul of Roman
purity and firmness. The questions which come before them frequently
involve the fate of the Constitution, the happiness of the
whole nation." (Wirt to Monroe, May 5, 1823, Kennedy, <span class="smcap">ii</span>, 153.)
</p><p>
Wirt, in this letter, was urging the appointment of Kent to the
Supreme Bench, notwithstanding the Federalism of the New York
Chancellor. "Federal politics are no way dangerous on the bench of
the Supreme Court," adds Wirt. (<i>Ib.</i> 155.)</p></div>

Throughout this session Webster appears to have been much disturbed.
For example, as early as April 10, 1824, he writes Story:
"I am exhausted. When I look in the glass, I think of our old New
England saying, 'As thin as a shad.' I have not vigor enough left,
either mental or physical, to try an action for assault and battery....
I shall call up some bills reported by our [Judiciary] committee....
The gentlemen of the West will propose a clause, requiring the assent
of a majority of all the judges to a judgment, which pronounces a
state law void, as being in violation of the constitution or laws of the
United States. Do you see any great evil in such a provision? Judge
Todd told me he thought it would give great satisfaction in the West.
In what phraseology would you make such a provision?" (Webster to
Story, April 10, 1824, <i>Priv. Corres.</i>: Webster, <span class="smcap">i</span>, 348-49.)</p></div>

<h3>COMMERCE MADE FREE</h3>

<p>Opposing rights to the same thing cannot exist under the Constitution of our
country. (Chancellor Nathan Sanford.)</p>

<p>At six o'clock in the evening of August 9, 1803, a
curious assembly of curious people was gathered at
a certain spot on the banks of the Seine in Paris.
They were gazing at a strange object on the river&mdash;the
model of an invention which was to affect the
destinies of the world more powerfully and permanently
than the victories and defeats of all the armies
that, for a dozen years thereafter, fought over the
ancient battle-fields of Europe from Moscow to Madrid.
The occasion was the first public exhibition of
Robert Fulton's steamboat.</p>

<p>France was once more gathering her strength for
the war which, in May, Great Britain had declared
upon her; and Bonaparte, as First Consul, was in
camp at Boulogne. Fulton had been experimenting
for a long time, and the public exhibition now in progress
would have been made months earlier had not
an accident delayed it. His activities had been reported
to Bonaparte, who promptly ordered members
of the Institute<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> to attend the exhibition and report
to him on the practicability of the invention, which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
he wrote, and in italics, "<i>may change the face of the
world</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1108_1108" id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> Prominent, therefore, among the throng
were these learned men, doubting and skeptical as
mere learning usually is.</p>

<p>More conspicuous than Bonaparte's scientific
agents, and as interested and confident as they were
indifferent or scornful, was a tall man of distinguished
bearing, whose powerful features, bold eyes,
aggressive chin, and acquisitive nose indicated a
character of unyielding determination, persistence,
and hopefulness. This was the American Minister to
France, Robert R. Livingston of New York, who,
three months before, had conducted the Louisiana
Purchase. By his side was Fulton himself, a man
of medium height, slender and erect, whose intellectual
brow and large, speculative eyes indicated the
dreamer and contriver.</p>

<p>The French scientists were not impressed, and the
French Government dropped consideration of the
subject. But Fulton and Livingston were greatly
encouraged. An engine designed by Fulton was ordered
from a Birmingham manufacturer and, when
constructed, was shipped to America.</p>

<p>For many years inventive minds had been at work
on the problem of steam navigation. Because of the
cost and difficulties of transportation, and the ever-growing
demand for means of cheap and easy water
carriage, the most active and fruitful efforts to solve
the problem had been made in America.<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> Livingston,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
then Chancellor of New York, had taken a deep and
practical interest in the subject.<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a> He had constructed
a boat on the Hudson, and was so confident of success
that, five years before the Paris experiments of
Fulton, he had procured from the New York Legislature
an act giving him the exclusive right for twenty
years to navigate by steamboats the streams and
other waters of the State, provided that, within a
year, he should build a boat making four miles an
hour against the current of the Hudson.<a name="FNanchor_1111_1111" id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> The only
difficulty Livingston encountered in securing the
passage of this act was the amused incredulity of
the legislators. The bill "was a standing subject of
ridicule" and had to run the gamut of jokes, jeers,
and raillery.<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a> The legislators did not object to granting
a monopoly on New York waters for a century or
for a thousand years,<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> provided the navigation was
by steam; but they required, in payment to themselves,
the price of derision and laughter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>

<p>Livingston failed to meet in time the conditions
of the steamboat act, but, with Livingston tenacity,<a name="FNanchor_1114_1114" id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a>
persevered in his efforts to build a practicable
vessel. When, in 1801, he arrived in Paris as American
Minister, his mind was almost as full of the
project as of his delicate and serious official tasks.</p>

<p>Robert Fulton was then living in the French Capital,
working on his models of steamboats, submarines,
and torpedoes, and striving to interest Napoleon
in his inventions.<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> Livingston and Fulton
soon met; a mutual admiration, trust, and friendship
followed and a partnership was formed.<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> Livingston
had left his interests in the hands of an alert
and capable agent, Nicholas J. Roosevelt, who, in
1803, had no difficulty in securing from the now hilarious
New York Legislature an extension of Livingston's
monopoly for twenty years upon the same
terms as the first.<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> Livingston resigned his office
and returned home. Within a year Fulton joined
his partner.</p>

<p>The grant of 1803 was forfeited like the preceding
one, because its conditions had not been complied
with in time, and another act was passed by the Legislature
reviving the grant and extending it for two
years.<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> Thus encouraged and secured, Fulton and
Livingston put forth every effort, and on Monday,
August 17, 1807, four years and eight days after
the dramatic exhibition on the river Seine in Paris,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
the North River,<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> the first successful steamboat,
made her voyage up the Hudson from New York
to Albany<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> and the success of the great enterprise
was assured.</p>

<p>On April 11, 1808, a final law was enacted by the
New York Legislature. The period of ridicule had
passed; the members of that body now voted with
serious knowledge of the possibilities of steam navigation.
The new act provided that, for each new
boat "established" on New York waters by Livingston
and Fulton and their associates, they should
be "entitled to five years prolongation of their
grant <i>or contract</i> with this state," the "whole term"
of their monopoly not to exceed thirty years. All
other persons were forbidden to navigate New York
waters by steam craft without a license from Livingston
and Fulton; and any unlicensed vessel, "together
with the engine, tackle and apparel thereof,"
should be forfeited to them.<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a></p>

<p>Obedient to "the great god, Success," the public
became as enthusiastic and friendly as it had been
frigid and hostile and eagerly patronized this pleasant,
cheap, and expeditious method of travel. The
profits quickly justified the faith and perseverance of
Livingston and Fulton. Soon three boats were running
between New York and Albany. The fare each
way was seven dollars and proportionate charges
were made for intermediate landings, of which there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
were eleven.<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> Immediately the monopoly began operating
steam ferryboats between New York City and
New Jersey.<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a> Having such solid reason for optimism,
Livingston and Fulton, with prudent foresight,
leaped half a continent and placed steamboats on
the Mississippi, the traffic of which they planned to
control by securing from the Legislature of Orleans
Territory the same exclusive privileges for steam
navigation upon Louisiana waters, which included
the mouth of the Mississippi,<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> that New York had
granted upon the waters of that State. Nicholas J.
Roosevelt was put in charge of this enterprise, and
in an incredibly short time the steamboat New
Orleans was ploughing the turgid and treacherous
currents of the great river.<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not long, however, before troubles came&mdash;the
first from New Jersey. Enterprising citizens of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
that State also built steamboats; but the owners of
any vessel entering New York waters, even though
acting merely as a ferry between Hoboken and New
York City, must procure a license from Livingston
and Fulton or forfeit their boats. From discontent at
this condition the feelings of the people rose to resentment
and then to anger. At last they determined
to retaliate, and early in 1811 the New Jersey Legislature
passed an act authorizing the owner of any
boat seized under the New York law, in turn to capture
and hold any steam-propelled craft belonging
"in part or in whole" to any citizen of New York;
"which boat ... shall be forfeited ... to the ... owner
... of such ... boats which may have been seized"
under the New York law.<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a></p>

<p>New York was not slow to reply. Her Legislature
was in session when that of New Jersey thus declared
commercial war. An act was speedily passed providing
that Livingston and Fulton might enforce at
law or in equity the forfeiture of boats unlicensed by
them, "as if the same had been tortiously and wrongfully
taken out of their possession"; and that when
such a suit was brought the defendants should be
enjoined from running the boat or "removing the
same or any part thereof out of the jurisdiction of
the court."<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a></p>

<p>Connecticut forbade any vessel licensed by Livingston
and Fulton from entering Connecticut waters.<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a>
The opposition to the New York steamboat
monopoly was not, however, confined to other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
States. Citizens of New York defied it and began to
run steam vessels on the Hudson.<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a> James Van Ingen
and associates were the first thus to challenge the
exclusive "contract," as the New York law termed
the franchise which the State had granted to Livingston
and Fulton. Suit was brought against Van
Ingen in the United States Circuit Court in New
York, praying that Livingston and Fulton be
"quieted in the possession," or in the exclusive right,
to navigate the Hudson secured to them by two
patents.<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> The bill was dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
Thus far the litigation was exclusively
a State controversy. Upon the face of the record
the National element did not appear; yet it was the
governing issue raised by the dispute.</p>

<p>Immediately Livingston and Fulton sued Van
Ingen and associates in the New York Court of
Chancery, praying that they be enjoined from operating
their boats. In an opinion of great ability and
almost meticulous learning, Chancellor John Lansing
denied the injunction; he was careful, however, not
to base his decision on a violation of the commerce
clause of the National Constitution by the New
York steamboat monopoly act. He merely held
that act to be invalid because it was a denial of a
natural right of all citizens alike to the free navigation
of the waters of the State. In such fashion the
National question was still evaded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<p>The Court of Errors<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> reversed the decree of Chancellor
Lansing. Justice Yates and Justice Thompson
delivered State Rights opinions that would have
done credit to Roane.<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> At this point the National
consideration develops. The opinion of James Kent,
then Chief Justice, was more moderate in its denial
of National power over the subject. Indeed, Kent
appears to have anticipated that the Supreme Court
would reverse him. Nevertheless, his opinion was
the source of all the arguments thereafter used in
defense of the steamboat monopoly. Because of this
fact; because of Kent's eminence as a jurist; and
because Marshall so crushingly answered his arguments,
a <i>pr&eacute;cis</i> of them must be given. It should be
borne in mind that Kent was defending a law
which, in a sense, was his own child; as a member of
the New York Council of Revision, he had passed
upon and approved it before its passage.</p>

<p>There could have been "no very obvious constitutional
objection" to the steamboat monopoly act,
began Kent, "or it would not so repeatedly have
escaped the notice of the several branches of the
government<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> when these acts were under consideration."<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a>
There had been five acts all told;<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> that of
1798 would surely have attracted attention since it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
was the first to be passed on the subject after the
National Constitution was adopted. It amounted
to "a legislative exposition" of State powers under
the new National Government.</p>

<p>Members of the New York Legislature of 1798 had
also been members of the State Convention that ratified
the Constitution, and "were masters of all the
critical discussions" attending the adoption of that
instrument. This was peculiarly true of that "exalted
character," John Jay, who was Governor at
that time; and "who was distinguished, as well in
the <i>council of revision</i>, as elsewhere, for the scrupulous
care and profound attention with which he examined
every question of a constitutional nature."<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> The
Act of 1811 was passed after the validity of the
previous ones had been challenged and "was, therefore,
equivalent to a declaratory opinion of high
authority, that the former laws were valid and constitutional."<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a></p>

<p>The people of New York had not "alienated" to
the National Government the power to grant exclusive
privileges. This was proved by the charters
granted by the State to banks, ferries, markets, canal
and bridge companies. "The legislative power in
a <i>single, independent government</i>, extends to every
proper object of power, and is limited only by its own
constitutional provisions, or by the fundamental
principles of all government, and the unalienable
rights of mankind."<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> In what respect did the steamboat
monopoly violate any of these restrictions? In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
no respect. "It interfered with no man's property."
Everybody could freely use the waters of New York
in the same manner that he had done before. So
there was "no violation of first principles."<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a></p>

<p>Neither did the New York steamboat acts violate
the National Constitution. State and Nation are
"supreme within their respective constitutional
spheres." It is true that when National and State
laws "come directly in contact, as when they are
aimed at each other," those of the State "must
yield"; but State Legislatures cannot all the time
be on the watch for some possible future collision.
The only "safe rule of construction" is this: "If any
given power was originally vested in this State, if it
has not been exclusively ceded to Congress, or if the
exercise of it has not been prohibited to the States,
we may then go on in the exercise of the power until
it comes practically in collision with the actual exercise
of some congressional power."<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a></p>

<p>The power given Congress to regulate commerce is
not, "in express terms, exclusive, and the only prohibition
upon the States" in this regard concerns the
making of treaties and the laying of tonnage import
or export duties. All commerce within a State
is "exclusively" within the power of that State.<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a>
Therefore, New York's steamboat grant to Livingston
and Fulton is valid. It conflicts with no act of
Congress, according to Kent, who cannot "perceive
any power which ... can lawfully carry to that extent."
If Congress has any control whatever over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
New York waters, it is concurrent with that of the
State, and even then, "no further than may be
incidental and requisite to the due regulation of
commerce between the States, and with foreign
nations."<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a></p>

<p>Kent then plunges into an appalling mass of authorities,
in dealing with which he delighted as much
as Marshall recoiled from the thought of them.<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> So
Livingston and Fulton's steamboat monopoly was
upheld.<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a></p>

<p>But what were New York waters and what were
New Jersey waters? Confusion upon this question
threatened to prevent the monopoly from gathering
fat profits from New Jersey traffic. Aaron Ogden,<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a>
who had purchased the privilege of running ferryboats
from New York to certain points on the New
Jersey shore, combined with one Thomas Gibbons,
who operated a boat between New Jersey landings,
to exchange passengers at Elizabethtown Point in
the latter State. Gibbons had not secured the per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>mission
of the New York steamboat monopoly to
navigate New York waters. By his partnership with
Ogden he, in reality, carried passengers from New
York to various points in New Jersey. In fact,
Ogden and Gibbons had a common traffic agent in
New York who booked passengers for routes, to
travel which required the service of the boats of both
Ogden and Gibbons.</p>

<p>So ran the allegations of the bill for an injunction
against the offending carriers filed in the New York
Court of Chancery by the steamboat monopoly in
the spring of 1819. Ogden answered that his license
applied only to waters "<i>exclusively</i> within the state
of New-York," and that the waters lying between the
New Jersey ports "are within the jurisdiction of <i>New
Jersey</i>." Gibbons admitted that he ran a boat between
New Jersey ports under "a coasting <i>license</i>"
from the National Government. He denied, however,
that the monopoly had "any exclusive right"
to run steamboats from New York to New Jersey.
Both Ogden and Gibbons disclaimed that they ran
boats in combination, or by agreement with each
other.<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a></p>

<p>Kent, now Chancellor, declared that a New York
statute<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a> asserted jurisdiction of the State over "the
whole of the river Hudson, southward of the northern
boundary of the city of New-York, and the whole of
the bay between Staten Island and Long or Nassau
Island." He refused to enjoin Ogden because he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
operated his boat under license of the steamboat
monopoly; but did enjoin Gibbons "from navigating
the waters in the bay of New-York, or Hudson
river, between Staten Island and Powles Hook."<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a></p>

<p>Ogden was content, but Gibbons, thoroughly angered
by the harshness of the steamboat monopoly
and by the decree of Chancellor Kent, began to run
boats regularly between New York and New Jersey in
direct competition with Ogden.<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> To stop his former
associate, now his rival, Ogden applied to Chancellor
Kent for an injunction. As in the preceding case,
Gibbons again set up his license from the National
Government, asserting that by virtue of this license
he was entitled to run his boats "in the coasting
trade between ports of the same state, or of different
states," and could not be excluded from such traffic
"by any law or grant of any particular state, on any
pretence to an exclusive right to navigate the waters
of any particular state by steam-boats." Moreover,
pleaded Gibbons, the representatives of Livingston
and Fulton had issued to Messrs. D. D. Tompkins,
Adam Brown, and Noah Brown a license to navigate
New York Bay; and this license had been assigned
to Gibbons.<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a></p>

<p>Kent held that the act of Congress,<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a> concerning
the enrollment and licensing of vessels for the coasting
trade, conferred no right "incompatible with an
exclusive right in Livingston and Fulton" to navigate
New York waters.<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> The validity of the steam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>boat
monopoly laws had been settled by the decision
of the Court of Errors in Livingston <i>vs.</i> Van Ingen.<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a>
If a National law gave to all vessels, "duly licensed"
by the National Government, the right to navigate
all waters "within the several states," despite State
laws to the contrary, the National statute would
"overrule and set aside" the incompatible legislation
of the States. "The only question that could
arise in such a case, would be, whether the [National]
law was constitutional." But that was not
the situation; "there is no collision between the act
of Congress and the acts of this State, creating the
steam-boat monopoly." At least "some judicial decision
of the supreme power of the Union, acting
upon those laws, in direct collision and conflict" with
them, is necessary before the courts of New York
"can retire from the support and defence of them."<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a></p>

<p>Undismayed, Gibbons lost no time in appealing to
the New York Court of Errors, and in January, 1820,
Justice Jonas Platt delivered the opinion of that tribunal.
Immediately after the decision in Livingston
<i>vs.</i> Van Ingen, he said, many, who formerly had resisted
the steamboat monopoly law, acquiesced in
the judgment of the State's highest court and secured
licenses from Livingston and Fulton. Ogden was one
of these. The Court of Errors rejected Gibbons's
defense, followed Chancellor Kent's opinion, and
affirmed his decree.<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a></p>

<p>Thus did the famous case of Gibbons <i>vs</i>. Ogden
reach the Supreme Court of the United States; thus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
was John Marshall given the opportunity to deliver
the last but one of his greatest nation-making opinions&mdash;an
opinion which, in the judgment of most
lawyers and jurists, is second only to that in M'Culloch
<i>vs.</i> Maryland in ability and statesmanship. By
some, indeed, it is thought to be superior even to that
state paper.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court, the bar, and the public anticipated
an Homeric combat of legal warriors when
the case was argued, since, for the first time, the
hitherto unrivaled Pinkney was to meet the new
legal champion, Daniel Webster, who had won his
right to that title by his efforts in the Dartmouth
College case and in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland.<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> It was
expected that the steamboat monopoly argument
would be made at the February session of 1821, and
Story wrote to a friend that "the arguments will be
very splendid."<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a></p>

<p>But, on March 16, 1821, the case was dismissed
because the record did not show that there was a
final decree in the court "from which said appeal
was made."<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> On January 10, 1822, the case was
again docketed, but was continued at each term of
the Supreme Court thereafter until February, 1824.
Thus, nearly four years elapsed from the time the
appeal was first taken until argument was heard.<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a></p>

<p>By the time the question was at last submitted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
Marshall, transportation had become the most pressing
and important of all economic and social problems
confronting the Nation, excepting only that of
slavery; nor was any so unsettled, so confused.</p>

<p>Localism had joined hands with monopoly&mdash;at
the most widely separated points in the Republic,
States had granted "exclusive privileges" to
the navigation of "State waters." At the time that
the last steamboat grant was made by New York to
Livingston and Fulton, in 1811, the Legislature of the
Territory of Orleans passed, and Governor Claiborne
approved, an act bestowing upon the New York
monopoly the same exclusive privileges conferred by
the New York statute. This had been done soon
after Nicholas J. Roosevelt had appeared in New
Orleans on the bridge of the first steamboat to navigate
the Mississippi. Whoever operated any steam
vessel upon Louisiana waters without license from
Livingston and Fulton must pay them $5000 for each
offense, and also forfeit the boat and equipment.<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a></p>

<p>The expectations of Livingston and Fulton of a
monopoly of the traffic of that master waterway were
thus fulfilled. When, a few months later, Louisiana
was admitted to the Union, the new State found
herself bound by this monopoly from which, however,
it does not appear that she wished to be released.
Thus Livingston and Fulton held the keys
to the two American ports into which poured the
greatest volume of domestic products for export,
and from which the largest quantity of foreign trade
found its way into the interior.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<p>Three years later Georgia granted to Samuel Howard
of Savannah a rigid monopoly to transport merchandise
upon Georgia waters in all vessels "or rafts"
towed by steam craft.<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> Anybody who infringed
Howard's monopoly was to forfeit $500 for each
offense, as well as the boat and its machinery. The
following year Massachusetts granted to John
Langdon Sullivan the "exclusive rights to the Connecticut
river within this Commonwealth for the use
of his patent steam towboats for ... twenty-eight
years."<a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> A few months afterwards New Hampshire
made a like grant to Sullivan.<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> About the same
time Vermont granted a monopoly of navigation in
the part of Lake Champlain under her jurisdiction.<a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a>
These are some examples of the general tendency of
States and the promoters of steam navigation to
make commerce pay tribute to monopoly by the
exercise of the sovereignty of States over waters
within their jurisdiction. Retaliation of State upon
State again appeared&mdash;and in the same fashion that
wrecked the States under the Confederation.<a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a></p>

<p>But this ancient monopolistic process could not
keep pace with the prodigious development of water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
travel and transportation by steamboat. On every
river, on every lake, glided these steam-driven vessels.
Their hoarse whistles startled the thinly settled
wilderness; or, at the landings on big rivers flowing
through more thickly peopled regions, brought
groups of onlookers to witness what then were considered
to be marvels of progress.<a name="FNanchor_1166_1166" id="FNanchor_1166_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a></p>

<p>By 1820 seventy-nine steamboats were running on
the Ohio between Pittsburgh and St. Louis, most of
them from 150 to 650 tons burden. Pittsburgh, Cincinnati,
and Louisville were the chief places where
these boats were built, though many were constructed
at smaller towns along the shore.<a name="FNanchor_1167_1167" id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> They
carried throngs of passengers and an ever-swelling
volume of freight. Tobacco, pork, beef, flour, corn-meal,
whiskey&mdash;all the products of the West<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> were
borne to market on the decks of steamboats which,
on the return voyage, were piled high with manufactured
goods.</p>

<p>River navigation was impeded, however, by snags,
sandbars, and shallows, while the traffic overland
was made difficult, dangerous, and expensive by
atrocious roads. Next to the frantic desire to unburden
themselves of debt by "relief laws" and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
forms of legislative contract-breaking, the thought
uppermost in the minds of the people was the improvement
of means of communication and transportation.
This popular demand was voiced in the second
session of the Fourteenth Congress. On
December 16, 1816, John C. Calhoun brought the
subject before the House.<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> Four days later he reported
a bill to devote to internal improvements
"the bonus of the National bank and the United
States's share of its dividends."<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> It met strenuous
opposition, chiefly on the ground that Congress had
no Constitutional power to expend money for such
purposes.<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> An able report was made to the House
based on the report of Secretary Gallatin in 1808.
The vital importance of "internal navigation" was
pointed out,<a name="FNanchor_1172_1172" id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> and the bill finally passed.<a name="FNanchor_1173_1173" id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a></p>

<p>The last official act of President James Madison
was the veto of this first bill for internal improvements
passed by Congress. The day before his
second term as President expired, he returned the
bill with the reasons for his disapproval of it. He
did this, he explained, because of the "insuperable
difficulty ... in reconciling the bill with the Constitution."
The power "proposed to be exercised
by the bill" was not "enumerated," nor could it
be deduced "by any just interpretation" from the
power of Congress "to make laws necessary and
proper" for the execution of powers expressly conferred
on Congress. "The power to regulate com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>merce
among the several States can not include a
power to construct roads and canals, and to improve
the navigation of water courses." Nor did the
"'common defense and general welfare'" clause
justify Congress in passing such a measure.<a name="FNanchor_1174_1174" id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a></p>

<p>But not thus was the popular demand to be silenced.
Hardly had the next session convened when
the subject was again taken up.<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> On December 15,
1817, Henry St. George Tucker of Virginia, chairman
of the Select Committee appointed to investigate
the subject, submitted an uncommonly able
report ending with a resolution that the Bank bonus
and dividends be expended on internal improvements
"with the assent of the States."<a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> For two
weeks this resolution was debated.<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> Every phase
of the power of Congress to regulate commerce was
examined. And so the controversy went on year
after year.</p>

<p>Three weeks before the argument of Gibbons <i>vs.</i>
Ogden came on in the Supreme Court, a debate began
in Congress over a bill to appropriate funds for surveying
roads and canals, and continued during all the
time that the court was considering the case. It was
going on, indeed, when Marshall delivered his opinion
and lasted for several weeks. Once more the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
respective powers of State and Nation over internal
improvements, over commerce, over almost
everything, were threshed out. As was usual with
him, John Randolph supplied the climax of the
debate.</p>

<p>Three days previous to the argument of Gibbons
<i>vs.</i> Ogden before Marshall and his associates, Randolph
arose in the House and delivered a speech
which, even for him, was unusually brilliant. In it
he revealed the intimate connection between the
slave power and opposition to the National control
of commerce. Randolph conceded the progress made
by Nationalism through the extension of the doctrine
of implied powers. The prophecy of Patrick
Henry as to the extinction of the sovereignty, rights,
and powers of the State had been largely realized,
he said. The promises of the Nationalists, made in
order to secure the ratification of the Constitution,
and without which pledges it never would have been
adopted, had been contemptuously broken, he intimated.
He might well have made the charge outright,
for it was entirely true.</p>

<p>Randolph laid upon Madison much of the blame
for the advancement of implied powers; and he
arraigned that always weak and now ageing man
in an effective passage of contemptuous eloquence.<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>When, in the election of 1800, continued Randolph,
the Federalists were overthrown, and "the construction
of the Constitution according to the
Hamiltonian version" was repudiated, "did we at
that day dream, ... that a new sect would arise
after them, which would so far transcend Alexander
Hamilton and his disciples, as they outwent
Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and John Taylor
of Caroline? This is the deplorable fact: such
is now the actual state of things in this land; ... it
speaks to the senses, so that every one may understand
it."<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> And to what will all this lead? To this,
at last: "If Congress possesses the power to do
what is proposed by this bill [appropriate money to
survey roads and canals], ... they may <i>emancipate
every slave in the United States</i><a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a>&mdash;and with stronger
color of reason than they can exercise the power
now contended for."</p>

<p>Let Southern men beware! If "a coalition of
knavery and fanaticism ... be got up on this floor,
I ask gentlemen, who stand in the same predicament
as I do, to look well to what they are now doing&mdash;to
the colossal power with which they are now arm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>ing
this Government."<a name="FNanchor_1181_1181" id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> And why, at the present
moment, insist on this "new construction of the
Constitution?... Are there not already causes enough
of jealousy and discord existing among us?... Is
this a time to increase those jealousies between
different quarters of the country already sufficiently
apparent?"</p>

<p>In closing, Randolph all but threatened armed
rebellion: "Should this bill pass, one more measure
only requires to be consummated; and then we, who
belong to that unfortunate portion of this Confederacy
which is south of Mason and Dixon's line, ...
have to make up our mind to perish ... or we must
resort to the measures which we first opposed to
British aggressions and usurpations&mdash;to maintain
that independence which the valor of our fathers
acquired, but which is every day sliding from under
our feet.... Sir, this is a state of things that cannot
last.... We shall keep on the windward side of
treason&mdash;but we must combine to resist, and that
effectually, these encroachments."<a name="FNanchor_1182_1182" id="FNanchor_1182_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, Congress and the country, particularly
the South, were deeply stirred by the tariff
question; in the debate then impending over the
Tariff of 1824, Nationalism and Marshall's theory
of Constitutional construction were to be denounced
in language almost as strong as that of Randolph
on internal improvements.<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> The Chief Justice and
his associates were keenly alive to this agitation;
they well knew that the principles to be upheld in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden would affect other interests and
concern other issues than those directly involved in
that case.</p>

<p>So it was, then, when the steamboat monopoly
case came on for hearing, that two groups of interests
were in conflict. State Sovereignty standing for
exclusive privileges as chief combatant, with Free
Trade and Slavery as brothers in arms, confronted
Nationalism, standing at that moment for the power
of the Nation over all commerce as the principal
combatant, with a Protective Tariff and Emancipation
as its most effective allies. Fate had interwoven
subjects that neither logically nor naturally had any
kinship.<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a></p>

<p>The specific question to be decided was whether
the New York steamboat monopoly laws violated
that provision of the National Constitution which
bestows on Congress the "power to regulate commerce
among the several States."</p>

<p>The absolute necessity of a general supervision
of commerce was the sole cause of the Convention
at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1786, which resulted in
the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia the
following year.<a name="FNanchor_1185_1185" id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> Since the adoption of uniform<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
commercial regulations was the prime object of the
Convention, there was no disagreement as to, or
discussion of, the propriety of giving Congress full
power over that subject. Every draft except one<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a>
of the Committee of Detail, the Committee of Style,
and the notes taken by members contained some
reference to a clause to that effect.<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a></p>

<p>The earliest exposition of the commerce clause of
the Constitution by any eminent National authority,
therefore, came from John Marshall. In his opinion
in Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden he spoke the first and last
authoritative word on that crucial subject.</p>

<p>Pinkney was fatally ill when the Supreme Court
convened in 1822 and died during that session. His
death was a heavy blow to the steamboat monopoly,
and his loss was not easily made good. It was finally
decided to employ Thomas J. Oakley, Attorney-General
of New York, a cold, clear reasoner, and
carefully trained lawyer, but lacking imagination,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
warmth, or breadth of vision.<a name="FNanchor_1188_1188" id="FNanchor_1188_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> He was not an adequate
substitute for the masterful and glowing Pinkney.</p>

<p>When on February 4, 1824, the argument at last
was begun, the interest in the case was so great that,
although the incomparable Pinkney was gone, the
court-room could hold but a small part of those who
wished to hear that brilliant legal debate. Thomas
Addis Emmet, whose "whole soul" was in the case,
appeared for the steamboat monopoly and made in
its behalf his last great argument. With him came
Oakley, who was expected to perform some marvelous
intellectual feat, his want of attractive qualities
of speech having enhanced his reputation as a
thinker. Wirt reported that he was "said to be one
of the first logicians of the age."<a name="FNanchor_1189_1189" id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a></p>

<p>Gibbons was represented by Webster who, says
Wirt, "is as ambitious as C&aelig;sar," and "will not be
outdone by any man, if it is within the compass of
his power to avoid it."<a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> Wirt appeared with Webster
against the New York monopoly. The argument
was opened by Webster; and never in Congress or
court had that surprising man prepared so carefully&mdash;and
never so successfully.<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> Of all his legal argu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>ments,
that in the steamboat case is incontestably
supreme. And, as far as the assistance of associate
counsel was concerned, Webster's address, unlike
that in the Dartmouth College case, was all his
own. It is true that every point he made had been
repeated many times in the Congressional debates
over internal improvements, or before the New
York courts in the steamboat litigation. But these
facts do not detract from the credit that is rightfully
Webster's for his tremendous argument in Gibbons
<i>vs.</i> Ogden.</p>

<p>He began by admissions&mdash;a dangerous method and
one which only a man of highest power can safely employ.
The steamboat monopoly law had been "deliberately
re-enacted," he said, and afterwards had the
"sanction" of various New York courts," than which
there were few, if any, in the country, more justly entitled
to respect and deference." Therefore he must,
acknowledged Webster, "make out a clear case" if
he hoped to win.<a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span></p>

<p>What was the state of the country with respect
to transportation? Everybody knew that the use
of steamboats had become general; everywhere they
plied over rivers and bays which often formed the
divisions between States. It was inevitable that
the regulations of such States should be "hostile"
to one another. Witness the antagonistic laws of
New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Surely
all these warring statutes were not "consistent with
the laws and constitution of the United States." If
any one of them were valid, would anybody "point
out where the state right stopped?"<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a></p>

<p>Webster carefully described the New York steamboat
monopoly laws, the rights they conferred, and
the prohibitions they inflicted.<a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a> He contended,
among other things, that these statutes violated
the National Constitution. "The power of Congress
to regulate commerce was complete and entire,"
said Webster, "and to a certain extent necessarily
exclusive."<a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> It was well known that the "immediate"
reason and "prevailing motive" for adopting
the Constitution was to "rescue" commerce "from
the embarrassing and destructive consequences resulting
from the legislation of so many different
states, and to place it under the protection of a
uniform law."<a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> The paramount object of establishing
the present Government was "to benefit and
improve" trade. This, said Webster, was proved
by the undisputed history of the period preceding
the Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_1197_1197" id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a></p>

<p>What commerce is to be regulated by Congress?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
Not that of the several States, but that of the Nation
as a "unit." Therefore, the regulation of it "must
necessarily be complete, entire and uniform. Its
character was to be described in the flag which
waved over it, <i>E Pluribus Unum</i>." Of consequence,
Congressional regulation of commerce must be
"exclusive." Individual States cannot "assert a
right of concurrent legislation, ... without manifest
encroachment and confusion."<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a></p>

<p>If New York can grant a monopoly over New
York Bay, so can Virginia over the entrance of
the Chesapeake, so can Massachusetts over the bay
bearing the name and under the jurisdiction of that
State. Worse still, every State may grant "an exclusive
right of entry of vessels into her ports."<a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a></p>

<p>Oakley, Emmet, and Wirt exhausted the learning
then extant on every point involved in the controversy.
Not even Pinkney at his best ever was more
thorough than was Emmet in his superb argument
in Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden.<a name="FNanchor_1200_1200" id="FNanchor_1200_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a></p>

<p>The small information possessed by the most careful
and thorough lawyers at that time concerning
important decisions in the Circuit Courts of the
United States, even when rendered by the Chief Justice
himself, is startlingly revealed in all these arguments.
Only four years previously, Marshall, at
Richmond, had rendered an opinion in which he asserted
the power of Congress over commerce as em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>phatically
as Webster or Wirt now insisted upon it.
This opinion would have greatly strengthened their
arguments, and undoubtedly they would have cited
it had they known of it. But neither Wirt nor Webster
made the slightest reference to the case of the
Brig Wilson <i>vs.</i> The United States, decided during
the May term, 1820.</p>

<p>One offense charged in the libel of that vessel by
the National Government was, that she had brought
into Virginia certain negroes in violation of the laws
of that State and in contravention of the act of Congress
forbidding the importation of negroes into
States whose laws prohibited their admission. Was
this act of Congress Constitutional? The power to
pass such a law is, says Marshall, "derived entirely"
from that clause of the Constitution which "enables
Congress, 'to regulate commerce with foreign nations,
and among the several States.'"<a name="FNanchor_1201_1201" id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> This power
includes navigation. The authority to forbid foreign
ships to enter our ports comes exclusively from the
commerce clause. "If this power over vessels is not
in Congress, where does it reside? Does it reside in
the States?</p>

<p>"No American politician has ever been so extravagant
as to contend for this. No man has been wild
enough to maintain, that, although the power to
regulate commerce, gives Congress an unlimited
power over the cargoes, it does not enable that body
to control the vehicle in which they are imported:
that, while the whole power of commerce is vested
in Congress, the state legislatures may confiscate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>every vessel which enters their ports, and Congress
is unable to prevent their entry."</p>

<p>The truth, continues Marshall, is that "even an
empty vessel, or a packet, employed solely in the
conveyance of passengers and letters, may be regulated
and forfeited" under a National law. "There
is not, in the Constitution, one syllable on the subject
of navigation. And yet, every power that pertains
to navigation has been ... rightfully exercised
by Congress. From the adoption of the Constitution,
till this time, the universal sense of America
has been, that the word commerce, as used in that
instrument, is to be considered a generic term,
comprehending navigation, or, that a control over
navigation is necessarily incidental to the power
to regulate commerce."<a name="FNanchor_1202_1202" id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a></p>

<p>Here was a weapon which Webster could have
wielded with effect, but he was unaware that it existed&mdash;a
fact the more remarkable in that both
Webster and Emmet commented, in their arguments,
upon State laws that prohibited the admission
of negroes.</p>

<p>But Webster never doubted that the court's decision
would be against the New York steamboat
monopoly laws. "Our Steam Boat case is not yet
decided, but it <i>can go but one way</i>," he wrote his
brother a week after the argument.<a name="FNanchor_1203_1203" id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a></p>

<p>On March 2, 1824, Marshall delivered that opinion
which has done more to knit the American people
into an indivisible Nation than any other one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
force in our history, excepting only war. In Marbury
<i>vs.</i> Madison he established that fundamental
principle of liberty that a permanent written constitution
controls a temporary Congress; in Fletcher
<i>vs.</i> Peck, in Sturges <i>vs.</i> Crowninshield, and in the
Dartmouth College case he asserted the sanctity of
good faith; in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland and Cohens
<i>vs.</i> Virginia he made the Government of the American
people a living thing; but in Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden
he welded that people into a unit by the force of
their mutual interests.</p>

<p>The validity of the steamboat monopoly laws
of New York, declares Marshall, has been repeatedly
upheld by the Legislature, the Council of Revision,
and the various courts of that State, and is
"supported by great names&mdash;by names which have
all the titles to consideration that virtue, intelligence,
and office, can bestow."<a name="FNanchor_1204_1204" id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a> Having paid this
tribute to Chancellor Kent&mdash;for every word of it
was meant for that great jurist&mdash;Marshall takes
up the capital question of construction.</p>

<p>It is urged, he says, that, before the adoption of
the Constitution, the States "were sovereign, were
completely independent, and were connected with
each other only by a league. This is true. But when
these allied sovereigns converted their league into
a government, when they converted their Congress
of Ambassadors, deputed to deliberate on their common
concerns, and to recommend measures of general
utility, into a legislature, empowered to enact
laws ... the whole character" of the States "under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>went
a change, the extent of which must be determined
by a fair consideration" of the Constitution.</p>

<p>Why ought the powers "expressly granted" to
the National Government to be "construed strictly,"
as many insist that they should be? "Is there one
sentence in the constitution which gives countenance
to this rule?" None has been pointed out;
none exists. What is meant by "a strict construction"?
Is it "that narrow construction, which
would cripple the government and render it unequal
to the objects for which it is declared to be instituted,<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a>
and to which the powers given, as fairly
understood, render it competent"? The court cannot
adopt such a rule for expounding the Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a></p>

<p>Just as men, "whose intentions require no concealment,"
use plain words to express their meaning,
so did "the enlightened patriots who framed our
constitution," and so did "the people who adopted
it." Surely they "intended what they have said."
If any serious doubt of their meaning arises, concerning
the extent of any power, "the objects for
which it was given ... should have great influence
in the construction."<a name="FNanchor_1207_1207" id="FNanchor_1207_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a></p>

<p>Apply this common-sense rule to the commerce
clause of the Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_1208_1208" id="FNanchor_1208_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a> What does the word<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
"commerce" mean? Strict constructionists, like
the advocates of the New York steamboat monopoly,
"limit it to ... buying and selling ... and do
not admit that it comprehends navigation." But
why not navigation? "Commerce ... is traffic, but
it is something more; it is intercourse." If this is not
true, then the National Government can make no
law concerning American vessels&mdash;"yet this power
has been exercised from the commencement of the
government, has been exercised with the consent of
all, and has been understood by all to be a commercial
regulation. All America understands ... the
word 'commerce' to comprehend navigation....
The power over commerce, including navigation,
was one of the primary objects for which the people
of America adopted their government.... The attempt
to restrict it [the meaning of the word "commerce"]
comes too late."</p>

<p>Was not the object of the Embargo, which "engaged
the attention of every man in the United
States," avowedly "the protection of commerce?...
By its friends and its enemies that law was treated
as a commercial, not as a war measure." Indeed, its
very object was "the avoiding of war." Resistance
to it was based, not on the denial that Congress can
regulate commerce, but on the ground that "a perpetual
embargo was the annihilation, and not the
regulation of commerce." This illustration proves
that "the universal understanding of the American
people" was, and is, that "a power to regulate navigation
is as expressly granted as if that term had been
added to the word 'commerce.'"<a name="FNanchor_1209_1209" id="FNanchor_1209_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span></p>

<p>Nobody denies that the National Government
has unlimited power over foreign commerce&mdash;"no
sort of trade can be carried on between this country
and any other, to which this power does not extend."
The same is true of commerce among the States.
The power of the National Government over trade
with foreign nations, and "among" the several
States, is conferred in the same sentence of the
Constitution, and "must carry the same meaning
throughout the sentence.... The word 'among'
means intermingled with." So "commerce among
the states cannot stop at the external boundary line
of each state, but may be introduced into the interior."
This does not, of course, include the "completely
interior traffic of a state."<a name="FNanchor_1210_1210" id="FNanchor_1210_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a></p>

<p>Everybody knows that foreign commerce is that
of the whole Nation and not of its parts. "Every
district has a right to participate in it. The deep
streams which penetrate our country in every direction,
pass through the interior of almost every state
in the Union." The power to regulate this commerce
"must be exercised whenever the subject exists.
If it exists within a state, if a foreign voyage may
commence or terminate within a state, then the
power of Congress may be exercised within a state."<a name="FNanchor_1211_1211" id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a></p>

<p>If possible, "this principle ... is still more clear,
when applied to commerce 'among the several
states.' They either join each other, in which case
they are separated by a mathematical line, or they
are remote from each other, in which case other
states lie between them.... Can a trading expedition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
between two adjoining states commence and terminate
outside of each?" The very idea is absurd.
And must not commerce between States "remote"
from one another, pass through States lying between
them? The power to regulate this commerce is in
the National Government.<a name="FNanchor_1212_1212" id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a></p>

<p>What is this power to "regulate commerce"? It
is the power "to prescribe the rule by which commerce
is to be governed. This power ... is complete
in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and
acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed
in the constitution;" and these do not affect
the present case. Power over interstate commerce "is
vested in Congress as absolutely as it would be in a
single government" under a Constitution like ours.
There is no danger that Congress will abuse this
power, because "the wisdom and the discretion of
Congress, their identity with the people, and the influence
which their constituents possess at election,
are, in this, as in many other instances, as that, for
example, of declaring war, the sole restraints on
which they [the people] have relied, to secure them
from its abuse. They are restraints on which the
people must often rely solely, in all representative
governments." The upshot of the whole dispute is,
declares Marshall, that Congress has power over
navigation "within the limits of every state ... so
far as that navigation may be, in any manner, connected"
with foreign or interstate trade.<a name="FNanchor_1213_1213" id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a></p>

<p>Marshall tries to answer the assertion that the
power to regulate commerce is concurrent in Con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>gress
and the State Legislatures; but, in doing so, he
is diffuse, prolix, and indirect. There is, he insists,
no analogy between the taxing power of Congress
and its power to regulate commerce; the former
"does not interfere with the power of the states to
tax for the support of their own governments." In
levying such taxes, the States "are not doing what
Congress is empowered to do." But when a State
regulates foreign or interstate commerce, "it is exercising
the very power ... and doing the very thing
which Congress is authorized to do." However, says
Marshall evasively, in the case before the court the
question whether Congress has exclusive power over
commerce, or whether the States can exercise it until
Congress acts, may be dismissed, since Congress
has legislated on the subject. So the only practical
question is: "Can a state regulate commerce with
foreign nations and among the states while Congress
is regulating it?"<a name="FNanchor_1214_1214" id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a></p>

<p>The argument is not sound that, since the States
are expressly forbidden to levy duties on tonnage,
exports, and imports which they might otherwise
have levied, they may exercise other commercial
regulations, not in like manner expressly prohibited.
For the taxation of exports, imports, and tonnage is
a part of the general taxing power and is not connected
with the power to regulate commerce. It is
true that duties on tonnage often are laid "with a
view to the regulation of commerce; but they may be
also imposed with a view to revenue," and, therefore,
the States are prohibited from laying such taxes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
There is a vast difference between taxation for the
regulation of commerce and taxation for raising
revenue. "Those illustrious statesmen and patriots"
who launched the Revolution and framed the Constitution
understood and acted upon this distinction:
"The right to regulate commerce, even by the
imposition of duties, was not controverted; but the
right to impose a duty for the purpose of revenue,
produced a war as important, perhaps, in its consequences
to the human race, as any the world has
ever witnessed."<a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a></p>

<p>In the same way, State inspection laws, while influencing
commerce, do not flow from a power to
regulate commerce. The purpose of inspection laws
is "to improve the quality of the articles produced
by the labor of the country.... They act upon the
subject before it becomes an article" of foreign or
interstate commerce. Such laws "form a portion
of that immense mass of legislation which embraces
everything within the territory of a state," and
"which can be most advantageously exercised by
the states themselves." Of this description are "inspection
laws, quarantine laws, health laws ... as
well as laws for regulating the internal commerce of
a state, and those which respect turnpike-roads,
ferries, etc."<a name="FNanchor_1216_1216" id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a></p>

<p>Legislation upon all these subjects is a matter of
State concern&mdash;Congress can act upon them only
"for national purposes ... where the power is expressly
given for a special purpose, or is clearly incidental
to some power which is expressly given."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
Obviously, however, the National Government "in
the exercise of its express powers, that, for example,
of regulating [foreign and interstate] commerce ...
may use means that may also be employed by a
state, ... that, for example, of regulating commerce
within the state." The National coasting laws,
though operating upon ports within the same State,
imply "no claim of a direct power to regulate the
purely internal commerce of a state, or to act directly
on its system of police." State laws on these
subjects, although of the "same character" as those
of Congress, do not flow from the same source
whence the National laws flow, "but from some other,
which remains with the state, and may be executed
by the same means." Although identical measures
may proceed from different powers, "this does not
prove that the powers themselves are identical."<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a></p>

<p>It is inevitable in a "complex system" of government
like ours that "contests respecting power must
arise" between State and Nation. But this "does
not prove that one is exercising, or has a right to
exercise, the powers of the other."<a name="FNanchor_1218_1218" id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a> It cannot be
inferred from National statutes requiring National
officials to "conform to, and assist in the execution
of the quarantine and health laws of a state ... that
a state may rightfully regulate commerce"; such
laws flow from "the acknowledged power of a state,
to provide for the health of its citizens." Nevertheless,
"Congress may control the state [quarantine
and health] laws, so far as it may be necessary to
control them, for the regulation of commerce."<a name="FNanchor_1219_1219" id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span></p>

<p>Marshall analyzes, at excessive length, National
and State laws on the importation of slaves, on
pilots, on lighthouses,<a name="FNanchor_1220_1220" id="FNanchor_1220_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> to show that such legislation
does not justify the inference that "the states possess,
concurrently" with Congress, "the power to
regulate commerce with foreign nations and among
the states."</p>

<p>In the regulation of "their own purely internal
affairs," States may pass laws which, although in
themselves proper, become invalid when they interfere
with a National law. Is this the case with the
New York steamboat monopoly acts? Have they
"come into collision with an act of Congress, and
deprived a citizen of a right to which that act entitles
him"? If so, it matters not whether the State
laws are the exercise of a concurrent power to regulate
commerce, or of a power to "regulate their domestic
trade and police." In either case, "the acts
of New York must yield to the law of Congress."<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a></p>

<p>This truth is "founded as well on the nature of the
government as on the words of the constitution."
The theory that if State and Nation each rightfully
pass conflicting laws on the same subject, "they
affect the subject, and each other, like equal opposing
powers," is demolished by the "supremacy" of the
Constitution and "of the laws made in pursuance
of it. The nullity of <i>any act</i>, inconsistent with the
constitution, is produced by the declaration that the
constitution is the supreme law." So when a State
statute, enacted under uncontrovertible State powers,
conflicts with a law, treaty, or the Constitution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
of the Nation, the State enactment "must yield
to it."<a name="FNanchor_1222_1222" id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a></p>

<p>It is not the Constitution, but "those laws whose
authority is acknowledged by civilized man throughout
the world" that "confer the right of intercourse
between state and state.... The constitution found
it an existing right, and gave to Congress the power
to regulate it. In the exercise of this power, Congress
has passed an act" regulating the coasting
trade. Any law "must imply a power to exercise the
right" it confers. How absurd, then, the contention
that, while the State of New York cannot prevent a
vessel licensed under the National coasting law, when
proceeding from a port in New Jersey to one in New
York, "from enjoying ... all the privileges conferred
by the act of Congress," nevertheless, the State of
New York "can shut her up in her own port, and
prohibit altogether her entering the waters and ports
of another state"!<a name="FNanchor_1223_1223" id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a></p>

<p>A National license to engage in the coasting trade
gives the right to navigate between ports of different
States.<a name="FNanchor_1224_1224" id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a> The fact that Gibbons's boats carried passengers
only did not make those vessels any the less
engaged in the coasting trade than if they carried
nothing but merchandise&mdash;"no clear distinction
is perceived between the power to regulate vessels
employed in transporting men for hire, and property
for hire.... A coasting vessel employed in the
transportation of passengers, is as much a portion
of the American marine as one employed in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
transportation of a cargo."<a name="FNanchor_1225_1225" id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a> Falling into his characteristic
over-explanation, Marshall proves the
obvious by many illustrations.<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a></p>

<p>However the question as to the nature of the
business is beside the point, since the steamboat
monopoly laws are based solely on the method of
propelling boats&mdash;"whether they are moved by
steam or wind. If by the former, the waters of New
York are closed against them, though their cargoes
be dutiable goods, which the laws of the United
States permit them to enter and deliver in New
York. If by the latter, those waters are free to them,
though they should carry passengers only." What
is the injury which Ogden complains that Gibbons
has done him? Not that Gibbons's boats carry passengers,
but only that those vessels "are moved by
steam."</p>

<p>"The writ of injunction and decree" of the State
court "restrain these [Gibbons's] licensed vessels,
not from carrying passengers, but from being moved
through the waters of New York by steam, for any
purpose whatever." Therefore, "the real and sole
question seems to be, whether a steam machine, in
actual use, deprives a vessel of the privileges conferred
by a [National] license." The answer is easy&mdash;indeed,
there is hardly any question to answer:
"The laws of Congress, for the regulation of commerce,
do not look to the principle by which vessels
are moved."<a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a></p>

<p>Steamboats may be admitted to the coasting trade
"in common with vessels using sails. They are ...<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
entitled to the same privileges, and can no more
be restrained from navigating waters, and entering
ports which are free to such vessels, than if they
were wafted on their voyage by the winds, instead
of being propelled by the agency of fire. The one
element may be as legitimately used as the other,
for every commercial purpose authorized by the
laws of the Union; and the act of a state inhibiting
the use of either to any vessel having a license under
the act of Congress comes ... in direct collision with
that act."<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a></p>

<p>Marshall refuses to discuss the question of Fulton's
patents since, regardless of that question,
the cause must be decided by the supremacy of
National over State laws that regulate commerce
between the States.</p>

<p>The Chief Justice apologizes, and very properly,
for taking so "much time ... to demonstrate propositions
which may have been thought axioms. It is
felt that the tediousness inseparable from the endeavor
to prove that which is already clear, is imputable
to a considerable part of this opinion. But
it was unavoidable." The question is so great, the
judges, from whose conclusions "we dissent," are so
eminent,<a name="FNanchor_1229_1229" id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a> the arguments at the bar so earnest, an
"unbroken" statement of principles upon which the
court's judgment rests so indispensable, that Marshall
feels that nothing should be omitted, nothing
taken for granted, nothing assumed.<a name="FNanchor_1230_1230" id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a></p>

<p>Having thus placated Kent, Marshall turns upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
his Virginia antagonists: "Powerful and ingenious
minds, taking, as postulates, that the powers expressly
granted to the government of the Union, are
to be contracted, by construction, into the narrowest
possible compass, and that the original powers of
the States are retained, if any possible construction
will retain them, may, by a course of well digested,
but refined and metaphysical reasoning, founded on
these premises, <i>explain away the constitution of our
country, and leave it a magnificent structure indeed,
to look at, but totally unfit for use</i>.</p>

<p>"They may so entangle and perplex the understanding,
as to obscure principles which were before
thought quite plain, and induce doubts where, if the
mind were to pursue its own course, none would be
perceived.</p>

<p>"In such a case, it is peculiarly necessary to
recur to safe and fundamental principles to sustain
those principles, and, when sustained, to make them
the tests of the arguments to be examined."<a name="FNanchor_1231_1231" id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a></p>

<p>So spoke John Marshall, in his seventieth year,
when closing the last but one of those decisive opinions
which vitalized the American Constitution, and
assured for himself the grateful and reverent homage
of the great body of the American people as long as
the American Nation shall endure. It is pleasant to
reflect that the occasion for this ultimate effort of
Marshall's genius was the extinction of a monopoly.</p>

<p>Marshall, the statesman, rather than the judge,
appears in his opinion. While avowing the most
determined Nationalism in the body of his opinion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
he is cautious, nevertheless, when coming to close
grips with the specific question of the respective
rights of Gibbons and Ogden. He is vague on the
question of concurrent powers of the States over
commerce, and rests the concrete result of his
opinion on the National coasting laws and the
National coasting license to Gibbons.</p>

<p>William Johnson, a Republican, appointed by
Jefferson, had, however, no such scruples. In view
of the strong influence Marshall had, by now, acquired
over Johnson, it appears to be not improbable
that the Chief Justice availed himself of the
political status of the South Carolinian, as well as
of his remarkable talents, to have Johnson state the
real views of the master of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>At any rate, Johnson delivered a separate opinion
so uncompromisingly Nationalist that Marshall's
Nationalism seems hesitant in comparison. In it
Johnson gives one of the best statements ever made,
before or since, of the regulation of commerce as the
moving purpose that brought about the American
Constitution. That instrument did not originate
liberty of trade: "The law of nations ... pronounces
all commerce legitimate in a state of peace, until
prohibited by positive law." So the power of Congress
over that vital matter "must be exclusive; it
can reside but in one potentate; and hence, the
grant of this power carries with it the whole subject,
leaving nothing for the state to act upon."<a name="FNanchor_1232_1232" id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a></p>

<p>Commercial laws! Were the whole of them "repealed
to-morrow, all commerce would be lawful."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
The authority of Congress to control foreign commerce
is precisely the same as that over interstate
commerce. The National power over navigation is
not "incidental to that of regulating commerce; ...
it is as the thing itself; inseparable from it as vital
motion is from vital existence.... Shipbuilding, the
carrying trade, and the propagation of seamen, are
such vital agents of commercial prosperity, that the
nation which could not legislate over these subjects
would not possess power to regulate commerce."<a name="FNanchor_1233_1233" id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a></p>

<p>Johnson therefore finds it "impossible" to agree
with Marshall that freedom of interstate commerce
rests on any such narrow basis as National coasting
law or license: "I do not regard it as the foundation
of the right set up in behalf of the appellant [Gibbons].
If there was any one object riding over every other
in the adoption of the constitution, it was to keep
the commercial intercourse among the states free
from all invidious and partial restraints.... If the
[National] licensing act was repealed to-morrow,"
Gibbons's right to the free navigation of New York
waters "would be as strong as it is under this
license."<a name="FNanchor_1234_1234" id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a></p>

<p>So it turned out that the first man appointed for
the purpose of thwarting Marshall's Nationalism,
expressed, twenty years after his appointment,
stronger Nationalist sentiments than Marshall himself
was, as yet, willing to avow openly. Johnson's
astonishing opinion in Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden is conclusive
proof of the mastery the Chief Justice had
acquired over his Republican associate, or else of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
the conquest by Nationalism of the mind of the
South Carolina Republican.</p>

<p>For the one and only time in his career on the
Supreme Bench, Marshall had pronounced a "popular"
opinion. The press acclaimed him as the deliverer
of the Nation from thralldom to monopoly.
His opinion, records the <i>New York Evening Post</i>,
delivered amidst "the most unbroken silence" of a
"courtroom ... crowded with people," was a wonderful
exhibition of intellect&mdash;"one of the most
powerful efforts of the human mind that has ever
been displayed from the bench of any court. Many
passages indicated a profoundness and a forecast in
relation to the destinies of our confederacy peculiar
to the great man who acted as the organ of the court.
The steamboat grant is at an end."<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a></p>

<p>Niles published Marshall's opinion in full,<a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> and
in this way it reached, directly or indirectly, every
paper, big and little, in the whole country, and was
reproduced by most of them. Many journals contained
long articles or editorials upon it, most of
them highly laudatory. <i>The New York Evening
Post</i> of March 8 declared that it would "command
the assent of every impartial mind competent to
embrace the subject." Thus, for the moment,
Marshall was considered the benefactor of the
people and the defender of the Nation against the
dragon of monopoly. His opinion in Gibbons <i>vs.</i>
Ogden changed into applause that disfavor which
his opinion in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland had evoked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
Only the Southern political leaders saw the "danger";
but so general was the satisfaction of the
public that they were, for the most part, quiescent
as to Marshall's assertion of Nationalism in this
particular case.</p>

<p>But few events in our history have had a larger
and more substantial effect on the well-being of the
American people than this decision, and Marshall's
opinion in the announcement of it. New York instantly
became a free port for all America. Steamboat
navigation of American rivers, relieved from
the terror of possible and actual State-created
monopolies, increased at an incredible rate; and,
because of two decades of restraint and fear, at
abnormal speed.<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a></p>

<p>New England manufacturers were given a new
life, since the transportation of anthracite coal&mdash;the
fuel recently discovered and aggravatingly
needed&mdash;was made cheap and easy. The owners
of factories, the promoters of steamboat traffic, the
innumerable builders of river craft on every navigable
stream in the country, the farmer who wished
to send his products to market, the manufacturer
who sought quick and inexpensive transportation
of his wares&mdash;all acclaimed Marshall's decision because
all found in it a means to their own interests.</p>

<p>The possibilities of transportation by steam railways
soon became a subject of discussion by enterprising
men, and Marshall's opinion gave them tre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>mendous
encouragement. It was a guarantee that
they might build railroads across State lines and be
safe from local interference with interstate traffic.
Could the Chief Justice have foreseen the development
of the railway as an agency of Nationalism, he
would have realized, in part, the permanent and
ever-growing importance of his opinion&mdash;in part,
but not wholly; for the telegraph, the telephone, the
oil and gas pipe line were also to be affected for the
general good by Marshall's statesmanship as set
forth in his outgiving in Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden.</p>

<p>It is not immoderate to say that no other judicial
pronouncement in history was so wedded to the inventive
genius of man and so interwoven with the
economic and social evolution of a nation and a
people. After almost a century, Marshall's Nationalist
theory of commerce is more potent than ever;
and nothing human is more certain than that it will
gather new strength as far into the future as forecast
can penetrate.</p>

<p>At the time of its delivery, nobody complained of
Marshall's opinion except the agents of the steamboat
monopoly, the theorists of Localism, and the
slave autocracy. All these influences beheld, in Marshall's
statesmanship, their inevitable extinction.
All correctly understood that the Nationalism expounded
by Marshall, if truly carried out, sounded
their doom.</p>

<p>Immediately after the decision was published, a
suit was brought in the New York Court of Equity,
apparently for the purpose of having that tribunal
define the extent of the Supreme Court's holding.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
John R. Livingston secured a coasting license for
the Olive Branch, and sent the boat from New York
to Albany, touching at Jersey and unloading there
two boxes of freight. The North River Steamboat
Company, assignee of the Livingston-Fulton monopoly,
at once applied for an injunction.<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a> The matter
excited intense interest, and Nathan Sanford,
who had succeeded Kent as Chancellor, took several
weeks to "consider the question."<a name="FNanchor_1239_1239" id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a></p>

<p>He delivered two opinions, the second almost as
Nationalist as that of Marshall. "The law of the
United States is supreme.... The state law is annihilated,
so far as the ground is occupied by the law
of the union; and the supreme law prevails, as if the
state law had never been made. The supremacy of
constitutional laws of the union, and the nullity of
state laws inconsistent with such laws of the union,
are principles of the constitution of the United
States.... So far as the law of the union acts upon
the case, the state law is extinguished.... Opposing
rights to the same thing, can not co-exist under
the constitution of our country."<a name="FNanchor_1240_1240" id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a> But Chancellor
Sanford held that, over commerce exclusively within
the State, the Nation had no control.</p>

<p>Livingston appealed to the Court of Errors, and
in February, 1825, the case was heard. The year
intervening since Marshall delivered his opinion
had witnessed the rise of an irresistible tide of public
sentiment in its favor; and this, more influential
than all arguments of counsel even upon an "in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>dependent
judiciary," was reflected in the opinion
delivered by John Woodworth, one of the judges
of the Supreme Court of that State. He quotes
Marshall liberally, and painstakingly analyzes his
opinion, which, says Woodworth, is confined to
commerce among the States to the exclusion of that
wholly within a single State. Over this latter trade
Congress has no power, except for "national purposes,"
and then only where such power is "'expressly
given ... or is clearly incidental to some
power expressly given.'"<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a></p>

<p>Chief Justice John Savage adopted the same
reasoning as did Justice Woodworth, and examined
Marshall's opinion with even greater particularity,
but arrived at the same conclusion. Savage adds,
however, "a few general remarks," and in these he
almost outruns the Nationalism of Marshall. "The
constitution ... should be so construed as best to
promote the great objects for which it was made";
among them a principal one was "'to form a more
perfect union,'" etc.<a name="FNanchor_1242_1242" id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a> The regulation of commerce
among the States "was one great and leading inducement
to the adoption" of the Nation's fundamental
law.<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> "We are the citizens of two distinct,
yet connected governments.... The powers given to
the general government are to be first satisfied."</p>

<p>To the warning that the State Governments
"will be swallowed up" by the National Government,
Savage declares, "my answer is, if such
danger exists, the states should not provoke a
termination of their existence, by encroachments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
on their part."<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a> In such ringing terms did Savage
endorse Marshall's opinion in Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden.</p>

<p>The State Senators "concurred" automatically in
the opinion of Chief Justice Savage, and the decree
of Chancellor Sanford, refusing an injunction on
straight trips of the Olive Branch between New York
landings, but granting one against commerce of any
kind with other States, was affirmed.</p>

<p>So the infinitely important controversy reached a
settlement that, to this day, has not been disturbed.
Commerce among the States is within the exclusive
control of the National Government, including that
which, though apparently confined to State traffic,
affects the business transactions of the Nation at
large. The only supervision that may be exercised
by a State over trade must be wholly confined to
that State, absolutely without any connection whatever
with intercourse with other States.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>One year after the decision of Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden,
the subject of the powers and duties of the Supreme
Court was again considered by Congress. During
February, 1825, an extended debate was held in the
Senate over a bill which, among other things, provided
for three additional members of that tribunal.<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a>
But the tone of its assailants had mellowed. The
voice of denunciation now uttered words of deference,
even praise. Senator Johnson, while still com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>plaining
of the evils of an "irresponsible" Judiciary,
softened his attack with encomium: "Our nation
has ever been blessed with a most distinguished Supreme
Court, ... eminent for moral worth, intellectual
vigor, extensive acquirements, and profound
judicial experience and knowledge.... Against the
Federal Judiciary, I have not the least malignant
emotion."<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> Senator John H. Eaton of Tennessee
said that Virginia's two members of the Supreme
Court (Marshall and Bushrod Washington) were
"men of distinction, ... whose decisions carried satisfaction
and confidence."<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a></p>

<p>Senator Isham Talbot of Kentucky paid tribute
to the "wise, mild, and guiding influence of this
solemn tribunal."<a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> In examining the Nationalist
decisions of the Supreme Court he went out of his
way to declare that he did not mean "to cast the
slightest shade of imputation on the purity of intention
or the correctness of judgment with which
justice is impartially dispensed from this exalted
bench."<a name="FNanchor_1249_1249" id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a></p>

<p>This remarkable change in the language of Congressional
attack upon the National Judiciary became
still more conspicuous at the next session in
the debate upon practically the same bill and various
amendments proposed to it. Promptly after Congress
convened in December, 1825, Webster himself
reported from the Judiciary Committee of the House<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
a bill increasing to ten the membership of the Supreme
Court and rearranging the circuits.<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a> This
measure passed substantially as reported.<a name="FNanchor_1251_1251" id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a></p>

<p>When the subject was taken up in the Senate,
Senator Martin Van Buren in an elaborate speech
pointed out the vast powers of that tribunal, unequaled
and without precedent in the history
of the world&mdash;powers which, if now "presented for
the first time," would undoubtedly be denied by the
people.<a name="FNanchor_1252_1252" id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a> Yet, strange as it may seem, opposition has
subsided in an astonishing manner, he said; even
those States whose laws have been nullified, "after
struggling with the giant strength of the Court,
have submitted to their fate."<a name="FNanchor_1253_1253" id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, says Van Buren, there has grown up "a
sentiment ... of idolatry for the Supreme Court ...
which claims for its members an almost entire exemption
from the fallibilities of our nature." The
press, especially, is influenced by this feeling of worship.
Van Buren himself concedes that the Justices
have "talents of the highest order and spotless integrity."
Marshall, in particular, deserves unbounded
praise and admiration: "That ... uncommon man
who now presides over the Court ... is, in all human
probability, the ablest Judge now sitting upon any
judicial bench in the world."<a name="FNanchor_1254_1254" id="FNanchor_1254_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span></p>

<p>The fiery John Rowan of Kentucky, now Senator
from that State, and one of the boldest opponents
of the National Judiciary, offered an amendment requiring
that "seven of the ten Justices of the Supreme
Court shall concur in any judgement or decree,
which denies the validity, or restrains the operation,
of the Constitution, or law of any of the
States, or any provision or enaction in either."<a name="FNanchor_1255_1255" id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a>
In advocating his amendment, however, Rowan,
while still earnestly attacking the "encroachments"
of the Supreme Court, admitted the "unsuspected
integrity" of the Justices upon which "suspicion
has never scowled.... The present incumbents are
above all suspicion; obliquity of motive has never
been ascribed to any of them."<a name="FNanchor_1256_1256" id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a> Nevertheless, he
complains of "a judicial superstition&mdash;which encircles
the Judges with infallibility."<a name="FNanchor_1257_1257" id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a></p>

<p>This seemingly miraculous alteration of public
opinion, manifesting itself within one year from the
violent outbursts of popular wrath against Marshall
and the National Judiciary, was the result of the
steady influence of the conservatives, unwearyingly
active for a quarter of a century; of the natural reaction
against extravagance of language and conduct
shown by the radicals during that time; of the
realization that the Supreme Court could be resisted
only by force continuously exercised; and, above all,
of the fundamental soundness and essential justness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
of Marshall's opinions, which, in spite of the local
and transient hardship they inflicted, in the end
appealed to the good sense and conscience of the
average man. Undoubtedly, too, the character of
the Chief Justice, which the Nation had come to
appreciate, was a powerful element in bringing about
the alteration in the popular concept of the Supreme
Court.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding the apparent diminution of
animosity toward the Chief Justice and the National
Judiciary, hatred of both continued, and within a
few years showed itself with greater violence than
ever. How Marshall met this recrudescence of
Localism is the story of his closing years.</p>

<p>When, in Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden, Marshall established
the supremacy of Congress over commerce
among the States, he also announced the absolute
power of the National Legislature to control trade
with foreign nations. It was not long before an opportunity
was afforded him to apply this principle,
and to supplement his first great opinion on the
meaning of the commerce clause, by another pronouncement
of equal power and dignity. By acts of
the Maryland Legislature importers or wholesalers
of imported goods were required to take out licenses,
costing fifty dollars each, before they could sell "by
wholesale, bale or package, hogshead, barrel, or
tierce." Non-observance of this requirement subjected
the offender to a fine of one hundred dollars
and forfeiture of the amount of the tax.<a name="FNanchor_1258_1258" id="FNanchor_1258_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a></p>

<p>Under this law Alexander Brown and his partners,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
George, John, and James Brown, were indicted in
the City Court of Baltimore for having sold a package
of foreign dry goods without a license. Judgment
against the merchants was rendered; and this
was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. The case was
then taken to the Supreme Court on a writ of error
and argued for Brown &amp; Co. by William Wirt and
Jonathan Meredith, and for Maryland by Roger
Brooke Taney<a name="FNanchor_1259_1259" id="FNanchor_1259_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a> and Reverdy Johnson.<a name="FNanchor_1260_1260" id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a></p>

<p>On March 12, 1827, the Chief Justice delivered
the opinion of the majority of the court, Justice
Thompson dissenting. The only question, says
Marshall, is whether a State can constitutionally
require an importer to take out a license "before he
shall be permitted to sell a bale or package" of imported
goods.<a name="FNanchor_1261_1261" id="FNanchor_1261_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> The Constitution prohibits any
State from laying imposts or duties on imports or
exports, except what may be "absolutely necessary
for executing its inspection laws." The Maryland
act clearly falls within this prohibition: "A duty on
imports ... is not merely a duty on the act of importation,
but is a duty on the thing imported....</p>

<p>"There is no difference," continues Marshall,
"between a power to prohibit the sale of an article
and a power to prohibit its introduction into the
country.... No goods would be imported if none<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
could be sold." The power which can levy a small
tax can impose a great one&mdash;can, in fact, prohibit
the thing taxed: "Questions of power do not depend
on the degree to which it may be exercised."<a name="FNanchor_1262_1262" id="FNanchor_1262_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> He
admits that "there must be a point of time when the
prohibition [of States to tax imports] ceases and the
power of the State to tax commences"; but "this
point of time is [not] the instant that the articles
enter the country."<a name="FNanchor_1263_1263" id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a></p>

<p>Here Marshall becomes wisely cautious. The
power of the States to tax and the "restriction"
on that power, "though quite distinguishable when
they do not approach each other, may yet, like the
intervening colors between white and black, approach
so nearly as to perplex the understanding,
as colors perplex the vision in marking the distinction
between them. Yet the distinction exists, and
must be marked as cases arise. Till they do arise, it
might be premature to state any rule as being universal
in its application. It is sufficient for the present,
to say, generally, that, when the importer has
so acted upon the thing imported that it has become
incorporated and mixed up with the mass of property
in the country, it has, perhaps, lost its distinctive
character as an import, and has become subject
to the taxing power of the State; but while remaining
the property of the importer, in his warehouse, in
the original form or package in which it was imported,
a tax upon it is too plainly a duty on imports
to escape the prohibition in the constitution."<a name="FNanchor_1264_1264" id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not true that under the rule just stated, the
State is precluded from regulating its internal trade
and from protecting the health or morals of its citizens.
The Constitutional inhibition against State
taxation of imports applies only to "the form in
which it was imported." When the importer sells
his goods "the [State] law may treat them as it
finds them." Measures may also be taken by the
State concerning dangerous substances like gunpowder
or "infectious or unsound articles"&mdash;such
measures are within the "police power, which unquestionably
remains, and ought to remain, with
the States." But State taxation of imported articles
in their original form is a violation of the clause of
the Constitution forbidding States to lay any imposts
or duties on imports and exports.<a name="FNanchor_1265_1265" id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a></p>

<p>Such taxation also violates the commerce clause.
Marshall once more outlines the reasons for inserting
that provision into the Constitution, cites his
opinion in Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden, and again declares
that the power of Congress to regulate commerce
"is co-extensive with the subject on which it acts
and cannot be stopped at the external boundary of a
State, but must enter its interior." This power,
therefore, "must be capable of authorizing the sale
of those articles which it introduces." In almost the
same words already used, the Chief Justice reiterates
that goods would not be imported if they could
not be sold. "Congress has a right, not only to authorize
importation, but to authorize the importer
to sell." A tariff law "offers the privilege [of im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>portation]
for sale at a fixed price to every person
who chooses to become a purchaser." By paying
the duty the importer makes a contract with the
National Government&mdash;"he ... purchase[s] the
privilege to sell."</p>

<p>"The conclusion, that the right to sell is connected
with the law permitting importation, as an
inseparable incident, is inevitable." To deny that
right "would break up commerce." The power of a
State "to tax its own citizens, or their property
within its territory," is "acknowledged" and is
"sacred"; but it cannot be exercised "so as to obstruct
or defeat the power [of Congress] to regulate
commerce." When State laws conflict with National
statutes, "that which is not supreme must
yield to that which is supreme"&mdash;a "great and
universal truth ... inseparable from the nature of
things," which "the constitution has applied ... to
the often interfering powers of the general and State
governments, as a vital principle of perpetual operation."</p>

<p>The States, through the taxing power, "cannot
reach and restrain the action of the national government
...&mdash;cannot reach the administration of justice
in the Courts of the Union, or the collection of
the taxes of the United States, or restrain the operation
of any law which Congress may constitutionally
pass&mdash;... cannot interfere with any regulation of
commerce." Otherwise a State might tax "goods in
their transit through the State from one port to another
for the purpose of re-exportation"; or tax articles
"passing through it from one State to another,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
for the purpose of traffic"; or tax "the transportation
of articles passing from the State itself to another
State for commercial purposes." Of what
avail the power given Congress by the Constitution
if the States may thus "derange the measures of
Congress to regulate commerce"?</p>

<p>Marshall is here addressing South Carolina and
other States which, at that time, were threatening
retaliation against the manufacturers of articles
protected by the tariff.<a name="FNanchor_1266_1266" id="FNanchor_1266_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a> He pointedly observes that
the decision in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland is "entirely
applicable" to the present controversy, and adds
that "we suppose the principle laid down in this
case to apply equally to importations from a sister
State."<a name="FNanchor_1267_1267" id="FNanchor_1267_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a></p>

<p>The principles announced by Marshall in Brown
<i>vs.</i> Maryland have been upheld by nearly all courts
that have since dealt with the subject of commerce.
But there has been much "distinguishing" of various
cases from that decision; and, in this process,
the application of his great opinion has often been
modified, sometimes evaded. In some cases in
which Marshall's statesmanship has thus been weakened
and narrowed, local public sentiment as to
questions that have come to be considered moral,
has been influential. It is fortunate for the Republic
that considerations of this kind did not, in such
fashion, impair the liberty of commerce among the
States before the American Nation was firmly established.
When estimating our indebtedness to
John Marshall, we must have in mind the state of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
the country at the time his Constitutional expositions
were pronounced and the inevitable and ruinous
effect that feebler and more restricted assertions
of Nationalism would then have had.</p>

<p>Seldom has a triumph of sound principles and of
sound reasoning in the assertion of those principles
been more frankly acknowledged than in the tribute
which Roger Brooke Taney inferentially paid to
John Marshall, whom he succeeded as Chief Justice.
Twenty years after the decision of Brown <i>vs.</i> Maryland,
Taney declared: "I at that time persuaded
myself that I was right.... But further and more
mature reflection has convinced me that the rule
laid down by the Supreme Court is a just and safe
one, and perhaps the best that could have been
adopted for preserving the right of the United
States on the one hand, and of the States on the
other, and preventing collision between them."<a name="FNanchor_1268_1268" id="FNanchor_1268_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a></p>

<p>Chief Justice Taney's experience has been that of
many thoughtful men who, for a season and when
agitated by intense concern for a particular cause or
policy, have felt Marshall to have been wrong in
this, that, or the other of his opinions. Frequently,
such men have, in the end, come to the steadfast
conclusion that they were wrong and that Marshall
was right.</p>

with Livingston in steamboat experiments. He had constructed the
engine for the craft with which Livingston tried to fulfill the conditions
of the first New York grant to him in 1798. Roosevelt was himself
an inventor, and to him belongs the idea of the vertical wheel for propelling
steamboats which Fulton afterward adopted with success.
(See J. H. B. Latrobe, in <i>Maryland Historical Society Fund-Publication</i>,
No. 5, 13-14.)
</p><p>
Roosevelt was also a manufacturer and made contracts with the
Government for rolled and drawn copper to be used in war-vessels.
The Government failed to carry out its agreement, and Roosevelt became
badly embarrassed financially. In this situation he entered into
an arrangement with Livingston and Fulton that if the report he was to
make to them should be favorable, he was to have one third interest
in the steamboat enterprise on the Western waters, while Livingston
and Fulton were to supply the funds.
</p><p>
The story of his investigations and experiments on the Ohio and
Mississippi glows with romance. Although forty-six years old, he had
but recently married and took his bride with him on this memorable
journey. At Pittsburgh he built a flatboat and on this the newly
wedded couple floated to New Orleans; the trip, with the long and
numerous stops to gather information concerning trade, transportation,
the volume and velocity of various streams, requiring six months'
time.
</p><p>
Before proceeding far Roosevelt became certain of success. Discovering
coal on the banks of the Ohio, he bought mines, set men at
work in them, and stored coal for the steamer he felt sure would be
built. His expectation was justified and, returning to New York from
New Orleans, he readily convinced Livingston and Fulton of the
practicability of the enterprise and was authorized to go back to Pittsburgh
to construct a steamboat, the design of which was made by
Fulton. By the summer of 1811 the vessel was finished. It cost
$38,000 and was named the New Orleans.
</p><p>
Late in September, 1811, the long voyage to New Orleans was begun,
the only passengers being Roosevelt and his wife. A great crowd
cheered them as the boat set out from Pittsburgh. At Cincinnati the
whole population greeted the arrival of this extraordinary craft. Mr.
and Mrs. Roosevelt were given a dinner at Louisville, where, however,
all declared that while the boat could go down the river, it never
could ascend. Roosevelt invited the banqueters to dine with him on
the New Orleans the next night and while toasts were being drunk
and hilarity prevailed, the vessel was got under way and swiftly proceeded
upstream, thus convincing the doubters of the power of the
steamboat.
</p><p>
From Louisville onward the voyage was thrilling. The earthquake
of 1811 came just after the New Orleans passed Louisville and this
changed the river channels. At another time the boat took fire and
was saved with difficulty. Along the shore the inhabitants were torn
between terror of the earthquake and fright at this monster of the
waters. The crew had to contend with snags, shoals, sandbars, and
other obstructions. Finally Natchez was reached and here thousands
of people gathered on the bluffs to witness this triumph of
science.
</p><p>
At last the vessel arrived at New Orleans and the first steamboat
voyage on the Ohio and Mississippi was an accomplished fact. The
experiment, which began two years before with the flatboat voyage of
a bride and groom, ended at the metropolis of the Southwest in the
marriage of the steamboat captain to Mrs. Roosevelt's maid, with
whom he had fallen in love during this thrilling and historic voyage.

of Latrobe's narrative is given in Preble: <i>Chronological History of the
Origin and Development of Steam Navigation</i>, 77-81.)</p></div>

A committee was appointed and reported the facts as Ogden stated
them; but concluded that, since New York had granted exclusive
steamboat privileges to Livingston, "the honor of the State requires
that its faith should be preserved." However, said the committee, the
Livingston-Fulton boats "are in substance the invention of John
Fitch," to whom the original monopoly was granted, after the expiration
of which "the right to use" steamboats "became common to all
the citizens of the United States." Moreover, the statements upon
which rested the Livingston monopoly of 1798 "were not true in
fact," Fitch having forestalled the claims of the Livingston pretensions.

on this subject have grown out of a fatal admission" by Madison
"which runs counter to the tenor of his whole political life, and is expressly
contradicted by one of the most luminous and able State
papers that ever was written [the Virginia Resolutions]&mdash;an admission
which gave a sanction to the principle that this Government had
the power to charter the present colossal Bank of the United States.
Sir, ... that act, and one other which I will not name [Madison's War
Message in 1812], bring forcibly home to my mind a train of melancholy
reflections on the miserable state of our mortal being:

trade only incidentally. Speaking of exports and imports, he said
that "the oppression of the uncommercial States was guarded agst. by
the power to regulate trade between the States." (<i>Ib.</i> 308.)
</p><p>
Writing in 1829, Madison said that the commerce clause "being in
the same terms with the power over foreign commerce, the same extent,
if taken literally, would belong to it. Yet it ... grew out of the
abuse of the power by the importing States in taxing the non-importing,
and was intended as a negative and preventive provision against
injustice among the States themselves, rather than as a power to be
used for the positive purposes of the General Government, in which
alone, however, the remedial power could be lodged." (Madison to
Cabell, Feb. 13, 1829, <i>ib.</i> <span class="smcap">iii</span>, 478.)</p></div>

fanciful story, hitherto accepted, that Webster was speaking on the tariff
in the House when he was suddenly notified that Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden
would be called for argument the next morning; and that, swiftly concluding
his great tariff argument, he went home, took medicine, slept
until ten o'clock that night, then rose, and in a strenuous effort worked
until 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on his argument in the steamboat case; and that this was
all the preparation he had for that glorious address. (Ticknor's reminiscences
of Webster, as quoted by Curtis, <span class="smcap">i</span>, 216-17.)
</p><p>
On its face, Webster's argument shows that this could not have
been true. The fact was that Webster had had charge of the case in
the Supreme Court for three years; and that, since the argument was
twice before expected, he had twice before prepared for it.
</p><p>
The legend about his being stopped in his tariff speech is utterly
without foundation. The debate on that subject did not even begin
in the House until February 11, 1824 (<i>Annals</i>, 18th Cong. 1st Sess.
1470), three days after the argument of Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden was concluded;
and Webster did not make his famous speech on the Tariff Bill
of 1824 until April 1-2, one month after the steamboat case had been
decided. (<i>Ib.</i> 2026-68.)
</p><p>
Moreover, as has been stated in the text, the debate on the survey
of roads and canals was on in the House when the argument in Gibbons
<i>vs</i>. Ogden was heard; had been in progress for three weeks previously
and continued for some time afterward; and in this debate
Webster did not participate. Indeed, the record shows that for more
than a week before the steamboat argument Webster took almost no
part in the House proceedings. (<i>Ib.</i> 1214-1318.)</p></div>

<h3>THE SUPREME CONSERVATIVE</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If a judge becomes odious to the people, let him be removed.
(William Branch Giles.)</p>

<p>Our wisest friends look with gloom to the future. (Joseph Story.)</p>

<p>I have always thought, from my earliest youth till now, that the greatest
scourge an angry Heaven ever inflicted upon an ungrateful and a sinning people,
was an ignorant, a corrupt, or a dependent judiciary. (Marshall.)</p></div>


<p>"I was in a very great crowd the other evening at
M<sup>rs</sup> Adams' drawing room, but I see very few persons
there whom I know &amp; fewer still in whom I take
any interest. A person as old as I am feels that his
home is his place of most comfort, and his old wife
the companion in the world in whose society he is
most happy.</p>

<p>"I dined yesterday with Mr. Randolph. He is
absorbed in the party politics of the day &amp; seems as
much engaged in them as he was twenty five years
past. It is very different with me. I long to leave
this busy bustling scene &amp; to return to the tranquility
of my family &amp; farm. Farewell my dearest Polly.
That Heaven may bless you is the unceasing prayer
of your ever affectionate</p>

</p>

<p>This letter to his ageing and afflicted wife, written
in his seventy-second year, reveals Marshall's state of
mind as he entered the final decade of his life. While
the last of his history-making and nation-building
opinions had been delivered, the years still before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
him were to be crowded with labor as arduous and
scenes as picturesque as any during his career on the
Bench. It was to be a period of disappointment and
grief, but also of that supreme reward for sound and
enduring work which comes from recognition of
the general and lasting benefit of that work and
of the greatness of mind and nobility of character of
him who performed it.</p>

<p>For twenty years the Chief Justice had not voted.
The last ballot he had cast was against the re&euml;lection
of Jefferson in 1804. From that time forward
until 1828, he had kept away from the polls. In the
latter year he probably voted for John Quincy
Adams, or rather against Andrew Jackson, who, as
Marshall thought, typified the recrudescence of that
unbridled democratic spirit which he so increasingly
feared and distrusted.<a name="FNanchor_1270_1270" id="FNanchor_1270_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a></p>

<span class="caption">JOHN MARSHALL</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span></p>
<p>Yet, even in so grave a crisis as Marshall believed
the Presidential election of 1828 to be, he shrank
from the appearance of partisanship. The <i>Marylander</i>,
a Baltimore Democratic paper, published an
item quoting Marshall as having said: "I have not
voted for twenty years; but I shall consider it a
solemn duty I owe my country to go to the polls and
vote at the next presidential election&mdash;for should
Jackson be elected, I shall look upon the government
as virtually dissolved."<a name="FNanchor_1271_1271" id="FNanchor_1271_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a></p>

<p>This item was widely published in the Administration
newspapers, including the Richmond <i>Whig
and Advertiser</i>. To this paper Marshall wrote, denying
the statement of the Baltimore publication:
"Holding the situation I do ... I have thought it
right to abstain from any public declarations on
the election; ... I admit having said in private that
though I had not voted since the establishment of
the general ticket system, and had believed that I
never should vote during its continuance, I might
probably depart from my resolution in this instance,
from the strong sense I felt of the injustice of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
charge of corruption against the President &amp; Secretary
of State: I never did use the other expressions
ascribed to me."<a name="FNanchor_1272_1272" id="FNanchor_1272_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a> This "card" the <i>Enquirer</i> reproduced,
together with the item from the <i>Marylander</i>,
commenting scathingly upon the methods of Adams's
supporters.</p>

<p>Clay, deeply touched, wrote the Chief Justice of
his appreciation and gratitude; but he is sorry that
Marshall paid any attention to the matter "because
it will subject you to a part of that abuse which is
so indiscriminately applied to ... everything standing
in the way of the election of a certain individual."<a name="FNanchor_1273_1273" id="FNanchor_1273_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a></p>

<p>Marshall was sorely worried. He writes Story
that the incident "provoked" him, "not because I
have any objection to its being known that my private
judgement is in favor of the re-election of M<sup>r</sup>
Adams, but because I have great objections to being
represented in the character of a furious partisan.
Intemperate language does not become my age or
office, and is foreign from my disposition and habits.
I was therefore not a little vexed at a publication
which represented me as using language which could
be uttered only by an angry party man."</p>

<p>He explains that the item got into the <i>Marylander</i>
through a remark of one of his nephews "who was on
the Adams convention" at Baltimore, to the effect
that he had heard Marshall say that, although he had
"not voted for upwards of twenty years" he "should
probably vote at the ensuing election." His nephew
wrote a denial, but it was not published. So, con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>cludes
Marshall, "I must bear the newspaper scurrility
which I had hoped to escape, and which is
generally reserved for more important personages
than myself. It is some consolation that it does not
wound me very deeply."<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a></p>

<p>It would seem that Marshall had early resolved to
go to any length to deprive the enemies of the National
Judiciary of any pretext for attacking him or
the Supreme Court because of any trace of partisan
activity on his part. One of the largest tasks he had
set for himself was to create public confidence in that
tribunal, and to raise it above the suspicion that party
considerations swayed its decisions. He had seen how
nearly the arrogance and political activity of the first
Federalist judges had wrecked the Supreme Court
and the whole Judicial establishment, and had resolved,
therefore, to lessen popular hostility to courts,
as far as his neutral attitude to party controversies
could accomplish that purpose.</p>

<p>It thus came about that Marshall refrained even
from exercising his right of suffrage from 1804 to
1828&mdash;perhaps, indeed, to the end of his life, since
it is not certain that he voted even at the election of
1828. Considering the intensity of his partisan feelings,
his refusal to vote, during nearly all the long
period when he was Chief Justice, was a real sacrifice,
the extent of which may be measured by the fact
that, according to his letter to Story, he did not even
vote against Madison in 1812, notwithstanding the
violence of his emotions aroused by the war.<a name="FNanchor_1275_1275" id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span></p>

<p>On March 4, 1829, Marshall administered the oath
of office to the newly elected President, Andrew
Jackson. No two men ever faced one another more
unlike in personality and character. The mild,
gentle, benignant features of the Chief Justice contrasted
strongly with the stern, rigid, and aggressive
countenance of "Old Hickory." The one stood for
the reign of law; the other for autocratic administration.
In Jackson, whim, prejudice, hatred, and fierce
affections were dominant; in Marshall, steady, level
views of life and government, devotion to order
and regularity, abhorrence of quarrel and feud, constancy
and evenness in friendship or conviction, were
the chief elements of character. Moreover, the
Chief Justice personified the static forces of society;
the new President was the product of a fresh upheaval
of democracy, not unlike that which had
placed Jefferson in power.</p>

<p>Marshall had administered the Presidential oath
seven times before&mdash;twice each to Jefferson, Madison,
and Monroe, and once to John Quincy Adams.
And now he was reading the solemn words to the
passionate frontier soldier from whose wild, undisciplined
character he feared so much. Marshall briefly
writes his wife about the inauguration: "We had
yesterday a most busy and crowded day. People
have flocked to Washington from every quarter of
the United States. When the oath was administered
to the President the computation is that 12 or 15000
people were present&mdash;a great number of them ladies.
A great ball was given at night to celebrate the election.
I of course did not attend it. The affliction of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
our son<a name="FNanchor_1276_1276" id="FNanchor_1276_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> would have been sufficient to restrain me
had I even felt a desire to go."<a name="FNanchor_1277_1277" id="FNanchor_1277_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a> In a previous letter
to his wife he forecast the crowds and commotion:
"The whole world it is said will be here.... I wish
I could leave it all and come to you. How much
more delightful would it be to me to sit by your side
than to witness all the pomp and parade of the
inauguration."<a name="FNanchor_1278_1278" id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a></p>

<p>Much as he had come to dislike taking part in
politics or in public affairs, except in the discharge of
his judicial duties, Marshall was prevailed upon to be
a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention
of 1829-30. He refused, at first, to stand for the
place and hastened to reassure his "dearest Polly."
"I am told," he continues in his letter describing
Jackson's induction into office, "by several that I
am held up as a candidate for the convention. I have
no desire to be in the convention and do not mean
to be a candidate. I should not trouble you with this
did I not apprehend that the idea of my wishing to
be in the convention might prevent some of my
friends who are themselves desirous of being in it
from becoming candidates. I therefore wish you to
give this information to Mr. Harvie.<a name="FNanchor_1279_1279" id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a>... Farewell
my dearest Polly. Your happiness is always nearest
the heart of your J. Marshall."<a name="FNanchor_1280_1280" id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a></p>

<p>He yielded, however, and wrote Story of his disgust
at having done so: "I am almost ashamed of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
my weakness and irresolution when I tell you that
I am a member of our convention. I was in earnest
when I told you that I would not come into that
body, and really believed that I should adhere to
that determination; but I have acted like a girl addressed
by a gentleman she does not positively dislike,
but is unwilling to marry. She is sure to yield
to the advice and persuasion of her friends.... The
body will contain a great deal of eloquence as well
as talent, and yet will do, I fear, much harm with
some good. Our freehold suffrage is, I believe,
gone past redemption. It is impossible to resist the
influence, I had almost said contagion of universal
example."<a name="FNanchor_1281_1281" id="FNanchor_1281_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a></p>

<p>For fifty-three years Virginia had been governed
under the constitution adopted at the beginning of
the Revolution. As early as the close of this war the
injustice and inadequacy of the Constitution of 1776
had become evident, and, as a member of the House
of Delegates, Marshall apparently had favored the
adoption of a new fundamental law for the State.<a name="FNanchor_1282_1282" id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a>
Almost continuously thereafter the subject had
been brought forward, but the conservatives always
had been strong enough to defeat constitutional
reform.</p>

<p>On July 12, 1816, in a letter to Samuel Kercheval,
one of the ablest documents he ever produced,
Jefferson had exposed the defects of Virginia's constitution
which, he truly said, was without "leading
principles." It denied equality of representation;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
the Governor was neither elected nor controlled
by the people; the higher judges were "dependent
on none but themselves." With unsparing severity
Jefferson denounces the County Court system.</p>

<p>Clearly and simply he enumerates the constructive
reforms imperatively demanded, beginning
with "General Suffrage" and "Equal representation,"
on which, however, he says that he wishes
"to take no public share" because that question
"has become a party one." Indeed, at the very
beginning of this brilliant and well-reasoned letter,
Jefferson tells Kercheval that it is "for your satisfaction
only, and not to be quoted before the
public."<a name="FNanchor_1283_1283" id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a></p>

<p>But Kercheval handed the letter around freely
and proposed to print it for general circulation. On
hearing of this, Jefferson was "alarmed" and wrote
Kercheval harshly, repeating that the letter was not
to be given out and demanding that the original and
copies be recalled.<a name="FNanchor_1284_1284" id="FNanchor_1284_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a> This uncharacteristic perturbation
of the former President reveals in startling
fashion the bitterness of the strife over the calling
of the convention, and over the issues confronting
that body in making a new constitution for
Virginia.</p>

<p>Of the serious problems to be solved by the Convention
of 1829-30, that of suffrage was the most
important. Up to that time nobody could vote in
Virginia except white owners of freehold estates.
Counties, regardless of size, had equal representation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
in the House of Delegates. This gave to the eastern
and southern slaveholding sections of the State, with
small counties having few voters, an immense preponderance
over the western and northwestern
sections, with large counties having many voters.
On the other hand, the rich slavery districts paid
much heavier taxes than the poorer free counties.<a name="FNanchor_1285_1285" id="FNanchor_1285_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a></p>

<p>Marshall was distressed by every issue, to settle
which the convention had been called. The question
of the qualification for suffrage especially agitated
him. Immediately after his election to the
convention, he wrote Story of his troubles and misgivings:
"We shall have a good deal of division and
a good deal of heat, I fear, in our convention. The
freehold principle will, I believe, be lost. It will,
however, be supported with zeal. If that zeal should
be successful I should not regret it. If we find that a
decided majority is against retaining it I should prefer
making a compromise by which a substantial
property qualification may be preserved in exchange
for it.</p>

<p>"I fear the excessive [torn&mdash;probably, democratic
spirit, coin]cident to victory after a hard fought
battle continued to the last extremity may lead to
universal suffrage or something very near it. What
is the prop[erty] qualification for your Senate?
How are your Senators apportioned on the State?
And how does your system work? The question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
whether white population alone, or white population
compounded with taxation, shall form the basis of
representation will excite perhaps more interest than
even the freehold suffrage. I wish we were well
through the difficulty."<a name="FNanchor_1286_1286" id="FNanchor_1286_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a></p>

<p>The Massachusetts Constitutional Convention had
been held nearly a decade before that of Virginia.
The problem of suffrage had troubled the delegates
almost as much as it now perplexed Marshall.
The reminiscent Pickering writes the Chief Justice
of the fight made in 1820 by the Massachusetts
conservatives against "the conceited innovators."
Story had been a delegate, and so had John Adams,
fainting with extreme age, but rich with the wisdom
of his eighty-five years: "He made a short, but
very good speech," begging the convention to retain
the State Senate as "the representative of <i>property</i>; ... the
number of Senators in each district was proportioned
to its direct taxes to the State revenue&mdash;and
not to its population. Some democrats desired
that the number of Senators should be apportioned
not according to the taxation, but exclusively to the
population. This, Mr. Adams and all the most intelligent
and considerate members opposed."<a name="FNanchor_1287_1287" id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a></p>

<p>Ultra-conservative as Marshall was, strongly as
he felt the great body of the people incapable of
self-government, he was deeply concerned for the
well-being of what he called "the mass of the people."
The best that can be done for them, he says in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
letter to Charles F. Mercer, is to educate them. "In
governments entirely popular" general education
"is more indispensable ... than in an other." The
labor problem troubles him sorely. When population
becomes so great that "the surplus hands"
must turn to other employment, a grave situation
will arise.</p>

<p>"As the supply exceeds the demand the price of
labour will cheapen until it affords a bare subsistence
to the labourer. The superadded demands of
a family can scarcely be satisfied and a slight indisposition,
one which suspends labour and compensation
for a few days produces famine and pauperism.
How is this to be prevented?" Education
may be relied on "in the present state of our population,
and for a long time to come.... But as our
country fills up how shall we escape the evils which
have followed a dense population?"<a name="FNanchor_1288_1288" id="FNanchor_1288_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a></p>

<p>The Chief Justice went to the Virginia Convention
a firm supporter of the strongest possible property
qualification for suffrage. On the question of slavery,
which arose in various forms, he had not made his
position clear. The slavery question, as a National
matter, perplexed and disturbed Marshall. There
was nothing in him of the humanitarian reformer,
but there was everything of the statesman. He
never had but one, and that a splendid, vision.</p>

<p>The American Nation was his dream; and to the
realization of it he consecrated his life. A full generation
after Marshall wrote his last despairing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
word on slavery, Abraham Lincoln expressed the
conviction which the great Chief Justice had entertained:
"I would save the Union. I would save
it the shortest way under the Constitution.... If I
could save the Union without freeing any slave, I
would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some
and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What
I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because
I believe it helps to save the Union."<a name="FNanchor_1289_1289" id="FNanchor_1289_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a></p>

<p>Pickering, the incessant, in one of his many and
voluminous letters to Marshall which the ancient
New Englander continued to write as long as he
lived, had bemoaned the existence of slavery&mdash;one
of the rare exhibitions of Liberalism displayed by
that adamantine Federalist conservative. Marshall
answered: "I concur with you in thinking that
nothing portends more calamity &amp; mischief to the
Southern States than their slave population. Yet
they seem to cherish the evil and to view with
immovable prejudice &amp; dislike every thing which
may tend to diminish it. I do not wonder that they
should resist any attempt, should one be made, to
interfere with the rights of property, but they have
a feverish jealousy of measures which may do good
without the hazard of harm that is, I think, very
unwise."<a name="FNanchor_1290_1290" id="FNanchor_1290_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a></p>

<p>Marshall heartily approved the plan of the American
Colonization Society to send free negroes back
to Africa. The Virginia branch of that organization<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
was formed in 1829, the year of the State Constitutional
Convention, and Marshall became a member.
Two years later he became President of the Virginia
branch, with James Madison, John Tyler, Abel P.
Upshur, and other prominent Virginians as Vice-Presidents.<a name="FNanchor_1291_1291" id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a>
In 1831, Marshall was elected one of
twenty-four Vice-Presidents of the National society,
among whom were Webster, Clay, Crawford, and
Lafayette.<a name="FNanchor_1292_1292" id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a></p>

<p>The Reverend R. R. Gurley, Secretary of this
organization, wrote to the more eminent members
asking for their views. Among those who replied
were Lafayette, Madison, and Marshall. The Chief
Justice says that he feels a "deep interest in the ... society,"
but refuses to "prepare any thing for
publication." The cause of this refusal is "the
present state of [his] family"<a name="FNanchor_1293_1293" id="FNanchor_1293_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a> and a determination
"long since formed ... against appearing in print
on any occasion." Nevertheless, he writes Gurley
a letter nearly seven hundred words in length.</p>

<p>Marshall thinks it "extremely desirable" that the
States shall pass "permanent laws" affording financial
aid to the colonization project. It will be "also
desirable" if this legislation can be secured "to
incline the people of color to migrate." He had
thought for a long time that it was just possible
that more negroes might like to go to Liberia than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
"can be provided for with the funds [of] the Society";
therefore he had "suggested, some years
past," to the managers, "to allow a small additional
bounty in lands to those who would pay their passage
in whole or in part."</p>

<p>To Marshall it appears to be of "great importance
to retain the countenance and protection of the General
Government. Some of our cruizers stationed
on the coast of Africa would, at the same time,
interrupt the slave trade&mdash;a horrid traffic detested
by all good men&mdash;and would protect the vessels
and commerce of the Colony from pirates who infest
those seas. The power of the government to afford
this aid is not, I believe, contested." He thinks the
plan of Rufus King to devote part of the proceeds
from the sale of public lands to a fund for the colonization
scheme, "the most effective that can be devised,"
Marshall makes a brief but dreary argument
for this method of raising funds for the exportation
of the freed blacks.</p>

<p>He thus closes this eminently practical letter:
"The removal of our colored population is, I think,
a common object, by no means confined to the slave
States, although they are more immediately interested
in it. The whole Union would be strengthened
by it, and relieved from a danger, whose extent
can scarcely be estimated." Furthermore, says the
Chief Justice, "it lessens very much ... the objection
in a political view to the application of this
ample fund [from the sale of the public domain],
that our lands are becoming an object for which the
States are to scramble, and which threatens to sow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
the seeds of discord among us instead of being what
they might be&mdash;a source of national wealth."<a name="FNanchor_1294_1294" id="FNanchor_1294_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a></p>

<p>Marshall delivered two opinions in which the
question of slavery was involved, but they throw
little light on his sentiments. In the case of the
Antelope he held that the slave trade was not prohibited
by international law as it then existed; but
since the court, including Story and Thompson,
both bitter antagonists of slavery, was unanimous,
the views of Marshall cannot be differentiated from
those of his associates. Spain and Portugal claimed
certain negroes forcibly taken from Spanish and
Portuguese slavers by an American slaver off the
coast of Africa. After picturesque vicissitudes the
vessel containing the blacks was captured by an
American revenue cutter and taken to Savannah
for adjudication.</p>

<p>In due course the case reached the Supreme Court
and was elaborately argued. The Government insisted
that the captured negroes should be given
their liberty, since they had been brought into the
country in violation of the statutes against the importation
of slaves. Spain and Portugal demanded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
them as slaves "acquired as property ... in the regular
course of legitimate commerce."<a name="FNanchor_1295_1295" id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a> It was not
surprising that opinion on the slave trade was "unsettled,"
said Marshall in delivering the opinion of
the court.</p>

<p>All "Christian and civilized nations ... have been
engaged in it.... Long usage, and general acquiescence"
have sanctioned it.<a name="FNanchor_1296_1296" id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a> America had been the
first to "check" the monstrous traffic. But, whatever
its feelings or the state of public opinion,
the court "must obey the mandate of the law."<a name="FNanchor_1297_1297" id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a>
He cites four English decisions, especially a recent
one by Sir William Scott, the effect of all being that
the slave trade "could not be pronounced contrary
to the law of nations."<a name="FNanchor_1298_1298" id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a></p>

<p>Every nation, therefore, has a right to engage in
it. Some nations may renounce that right sanctioned
by "universal assent." But other nations cannot
be bound by such "renunciation." For all nations,
large and small, are equal&mdash;"Russia and Geneva
have equal rights." No one nation "can rightfully
impose a rule on another ... none can make a law
of nations; and this traffic remains lawful to those
whose governments have not forbidden it.... It
follows, that a foreign vessel engaged in the African
slave trade, captured on the high seas in time of
peace, by an American cruiser, and brought in for
adjudication, would be restored."<a name="FNanchor_1299_1299" id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a></p>

<p>Four months before Marshall was elected a member
of the Virginia Constitutional Convention, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
delivered another opinion involving the legal status
of slaves. Several negroes, the property of one
Robert Boyce, were on a steamboat, the Teche,
which was descending the Mississippi. The vessel
took fire and those on board, including the negroes,
escaped to the shore. Another steamboat, the Washington,
was coming up the river at the time, and
her captain, in response to appeals from the stranded
passengers of the burning vessel, sent a yawl to
bring them to the Washington. The yawl was upset
and the slaves drowned. The owner of them sued
the owner of the Washington for their value. The
District Court held that the doctrine of common
carriers did not apply to human beings; and this
was the only question before the Supreme Court, to
which Boyce appealed.</p>

<p>"A slave ... cannot be stowed away as a common
package," said Marshall in his brief opinion. "The
responsibility of the carrier should be measured by
the law which is applicable to passengers, rather
than by that which is applicable to the carriage of
common goods.... The law applicable to common
carriers is one of great rigor.... It has not been
applied to living men, and ... ought not to be applied
to them." Nevertheless, "the ancient rule 'that
the carrier is liable only for ordinary neglect,' still
applies" to slaves. Therefore the District Court was
right in its instructions to the jury.<a name="FNanchor_1300_1300" id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a></p>

<p>The two letters quoted and the opinions expressing
the unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court are
all the data we have as to Marshall's views on slav<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>ery.
It appears that he regretted the existence of
slavery, feared the results of it, saw no way of getting
rid of it, but hoped to lessen the evil by colonizing in
Africa such free black people as were willing to go
there. In short, Marshall held the opinion on slavery
generally prevailing at that time. He was far more
concerned that the Union should be strengthened,
and dissension in Virginia quieted, than he was
over the problem of human bondage, of which he
saw no solution.</p>

<p>When he took his seat as a delegate to the Virginia
Constitutional Convention of 1829-30, a more determined
conservative than Marshall did not live.
Apparently he did not want anything changed&mdash;especially
if the change involved conflict&mdash;except,
of course, the relation of the States to the Nation.
He was against a new constitution for Virginia;
against any extension of suffrage; against any modification
of the County Court system except to
strengthen it; against a free white basis of representation;
against legislative interference with
business. His attitude was not new, nor had he
ever concealed his views.</p>

<p>His opinions of legislation and corporate property,
for instance, are revealed in a letter written twenty
years before the Convention of 1829-30. In withdrawing
from some Virginia corporation because the
General Assembly of the State had passed a law for
the control of it, Marshall wrote: "I consider the interference
of the legislature in the management of
our private affairs, whether those affairs are committed
to a company or remain under individual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
direction, as equally dangerous and unwise. I have
always thought so and I still think so. I may be
compelled to subject my property to these interferences,
and when compelled I shall submit; but I will
not voluntarily expose myself to the exercise of a
power which I think so improperly usurped."<a name="FNanchor_1301_1301" id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a></p>

<p>Two years before the convention was called, Marshall's
unyielding conservatism was displayed in a
most conspicuous manner. In Sturges <i>vs.</i> Crowninshield,<a name="FNanchor_1302_1302" id="FNanchor_1302_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a>
a State law had been held invalid which relieved
creditors from contracts made before the passage
of that law. But, in his opinion in that case,
Marshall used language that also applied to contracts
made after the enactment of insolvency statutes;
and the bench and bar generally had accepted
his statement as the settled opinion of the Supreme
Court. But so acute had public discontent become
over this rigid doctrine, so strident the demand for
bankrupt laws relieving insolvents, at least from
contracts made after such statutes were enacted,
that the majority of the Supreme Court yielded
to popular insistence and, in Ogden <i>vs.</i> Saunders,<a name="FNanchor_1303_1303" id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a>
held that "an insolvent law of a State does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
impair the obligation of future contracts between
its citizens."<a name="FNanchor_1304_1304" id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a></p>

<p>For the first time in twenty-seven years the majority
of the court opposed Marshall on a question
of Constitutional law. The Chief Justice dissented
and delivered one of the most powerful opinions he
ever wrote. The very "nature of our Union," he
says, makes us "one people, as to commercial objects."<a name="FNanchor_1305_1305" id="FNanchor_1305_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a>
The prohibition in the contract clause "is
complete and total. There is no exception from it.<a name="FNanchor_1306_1306" id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a>...
Insolvent laws are to operate on a future, contingent
unforseen event."<a name="FNanchor_1307_1307" id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a> Yet the majority of the
court hold that such legislation enters into subsequent
contracts "so completely as to become a ... part"
of them. If this is true of one law, it is true
of "every other law which relates to the subject."</p>

<p>But this would mean, contends Marshall, that a
vital provision of the Constitution, "one on which
the good and the wise reposed confidently for securing
the prosperity and harmony of our citizens,
would lie prostrate, and be construed into an
inanimate, inoperative, unmeaning clause." The
construction of the majority of the court would
"convert an inhibition to pass laws impairing the
obligation of contracts into an inhibition to pass
retrospective laws."<a name="FNanchor_1308_1308" id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a> If the Constitution means
this, why is it not so expressed? The mischievous
laws which caused the insertion of the contract
clause "embraced future contracts, as well as those
previously formed."<a name="FNanchor_1309_1309" id="FNanchor_1309_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span></p>

<p>The gist of Marshall's voluminous opinion in
Ogden <i>vs.</i> Saunders is that the Constitution protects
all contracts, past or future, from State legislation
which in any manner impairs their obligation.<a name="FNanchor_1310_1310" id="FNanchor_1310_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a> Considering
that even the rigidly conservative Bushrod
Washington, Marshall's stanch supporter, refused to
follow his stern philosophy, in this case, the measure
and character of Marshall's conservatism are seen
when, in his seventy-fifth year, he helped to frame
a new constitution for Virginia.</p>

<p>Still another example of Marshall's rock-like conservatism
and of the persistence with which he held
fast to his views is afforded by a second dissent from
the majority of the court at the same session. This
time every one of the Associate Justices was against
him, and Story delivered their unanimous opinion.
The Bank of the United States had sued Julius B.
Dandridge, cashier of the Richmond branch, and his
sureties, on his official bond. Marshall, sitting as
Circuit Judge, had held that only the written record
of the bank's board of directors, that they approved
and accepted the bond, could be received to prove
that Dandridge had been legally authorized to act
as cashier.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court reversed Marshall's judgment,
holding that the authorization of an agent by a
corporation can be established by presumptive evidence,<a name="FNanchor_1311_1311" id="FNanchor_1311_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a>
an opinion that was plainly sound and which
stated the law as it has continued to be ever since.
But despite the unanimity of his brethren, the clear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
and convincing opinion of Story, the disapproval of
his own views by the bench, bar, and business men
of the whole country, Marshall would not yield.
"The Ch: Jus: I fear will <i>die hard</i>," wrote Webster,
who was of counsel for the bank.<a name="FNanchor_1312_1312" id="FNanchor_1312_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a></p>

<p>In a very long opinion Marshall insists that his
decision in the Circuit Court was right, fortifying his
argument by more than thirty citations. He begins
by frank acknowledgment of the discontent his decision
in the Circuit Court has aroused: "I should
now, as is my custom, when I have the misfortune
to differ with this court, acquiesce silently in its opinion,
did I not believe that the judgment of the circuit
court of Virginia gave general surprise to the
profession, and was generally condemned." Corporations,
"being destitute of human organs," can express
themselves only by writing. They must act through
agents; but the agency can be created and proved
only by writing.</p>

<p>Marshall points out the serious possibilities to
those with whom corporations deal, as well as to the
corporations themselves, of the acts of persons serving
as agents without authority of record.<a name="FNanchor_1313_1313" id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a> Powerful
as his reasoning is, it is based on mistaken premises
inapplicable to modern corporate transactions; but
his position, his method, his very style, reveal the
stubborn conservative at bay, bravely defending
himself and his views.</p>

<p>This, then, was the John Marshall, who, in his old
age, accepted the call of men as conservative as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
himself to help frame a new constitution for Virginia,
On Monday, October 5, 1829, the convention met
in the House of Delegates at Richmond. James Madison,
then in his seventy-ninth year, feeble and
wizened, called the members to order and nominated
James Monroe for President of the convention.
This nomination was seconded by Marshall.
These three men, whose careers since before the
Revolution and throughout our formative period,
had been more distinguished, up to that time, than
had that of any American then living, were the most
conspicuous persons in that notable Assembly.
Giles, now Governor of the State, was also a member;
so were Randolph, Tyler, Philip P. Barbour,
Upshur, and Tazewell. Indeed, the very ablest men
in Virginia had been chosen to make a new constitution
for the State. In the people's anxiety to
select the best men to do that important work,
delegates were chosen regardless of the districts in
which they lived.<a name="FNanchor_1314_1314" id="FNanchor_1314_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a></p>

<p>To Marshall, who naturally was appointed to the
Judiciary Committee,<a name="FNanchor_1315_1315" id="FNanchor_1315_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> fell the task of presenting to
the convention the first petition of non-freeholders
for suffrage.<a name="FNanchor_1316_1316" id="FNanchor_1316_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a> No more impressive document was
read before that body. It stated the whole democratic
argument clearly and boldly.<a name="FNanchor_1317_1317" id="FNanchor_1317_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a> The first
report received from any committee was made by
Marshall and also was written by him.<a name="FNanchor_1318_1318" id="FNanchor_1318_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a> It provided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
for the organization of the State Judiciary, but did
not seek materially to change the system of appointments
of judges.</p>

<p>Two sentences of this report are important: "No
modification or abolition of any Court, shall be construed
to deprive any Judge thereof of his office";
and, "Judges may be removed from office by a vote
of the General Assembly: but two-thirds of the whole
number of each House must concur in such vote."<a name="FNanchor_1319_1319" id="FNanchor_1319_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a>
Marshall promptly moved that this report be made
the order of the day and this was done.</p>

<p>Ranking next to the question of the basis of suffrage
and of representation was that of judiciary reform.
To accomplish this reform was one of the objects
for which the convention had been called. At
that time the Judiciary of Virginia was not merely a
matter of courts and judges; it involved the entire
social and political organization of that State. No
more essentially aristocratic scheme of government
ever existed in America. Coming down from Colonial
times, it had been perpetuated by the Revolutionary
Constitution of 1776. It had, in practical
results, some good qualities and others that were
evil, among the latter a well-nigh faultless political
mechanism.<a name="FNanchor_1320_1320" id="FNanchor_1320_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a></p>

<p>The heart of this system was the County Courts.
Too much emphasis cannot be placed on this fact.
These local tribunals consisted of justices of the
peace who sat together as County Courts for the
hearing and decision of the more important cases.
They were almost always the first men of their coun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>ties,
appointed by the Governor for life; vacancies
were, in practice, filled only on the recommendation
of the remaining justices. While the Constitution
of 1776 did not require the Governor to accept the
nominations of the County Courts for vacancies in
these offices, to do so had been a custom long established.<a name="FNanchor_1321_1321" id="FNanchor_1321_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a></p>

<p>For this acquiescence of the Governor in the recommendation
of the County Courts, there was a very
human reason of even weightier influence than that
of immemorial practice. The Legislature chose the
Governor; and the justices of the peace selected, in
most cases, the candidates for the Legislature&mdash;seldom
was any man elected by the people to the
State Senate or House of Delegates who was not
approved by the County Courts. Moreover, the
other county offices, such as county clerks and sheriffs,
were appointed by the Governor only on the
suggestion of the justices of the peace; and these
officials worked in absolute agreement with the local
judicial oligarchy. In this wise members of Congress
were, in effect, named by the County Courts, and
the Legislature dared not and did not elect United
States Senators of whom the justices of the peace
disapproved.</p>

<p>The members of the Court of Appeals, appointed
by the Governor, were never offensive to these minor
county magistrates, although the judges of this highest
tribunal in Virginia, always able and learned men
holding their places for life, had great influence over
the County Courts, and, therefore, over the Gover<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>nor
and General Assembly also. Nor was this the
limit of the powers of the County Courts. They fixed
the county rate of taxation and exercised all local
legislative and executive as well as judicial power.<a name="FNanchor_1322_1322" id="FNanchor_1322_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a></p>

<p>In theory, a more oligarchic system never was devised
for the government of a free state; but in practice,
it responded to the variations of public opinion
with almost the precision of a thermometer. For
example, nearly all the justices of the peace were
Federalists during the first two years of Washington's
Administration; yet the State supported Henry
against Assumption, and, later, went over to Jefferson
as against Washington and Henry combined.<a name="FNanchor_1323_1323" id="FNanchor_1323_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a></p>

<p>Rigid and self-perpetuating as was the official
aristocracy which the Virginia judicial system had
created, its members generally attended to their
duties and did well their public work.<a name="FNanchor_1324_1324" id="FNanchor_1324_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a> They lived
among the people, looked after the common good,
composed disputes between individuals; soothed
local animosities, prevented litigation; and administered
justice satisfactorily when, despite their preventive
efforts, men would bring suits. But the
whole scheme was the very negation of democracy.<a name="FNanchor_1325_1325" id="FNanchor_1325_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a></p>

<p>While, therefore, this judicial-social-political plan
worked well for the most part, the idea of it was
offensive to liberal-minded men who believed in
democracy as a principle. Moreover, the official<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
oligarchy was more powerful in the heavy slaveholding,
than in the comparatively "free labor," sections;
it had been longer established, and it better
fitted conditions, east of the mountains.</p>

<p>So it came about that there was, at last, a demand
for judicial reform. Seemingly this demand was
not radical&mdash;it was only that the self-perpetuating
County Court system should be changed to appointments
by the Governor without regard to recommendations
of the local justices; but, in reality, this
change would have destroyed the traditional aristocratic
organization of the political, social, and to
a great extent the economic, life of Virginia.</p>

<p>On every issue over which the factions of this
convention fought, Marshall was reactionary and
employed all his skill to defeat, whenever possible,
the plans and purposes of the radicals. In pursuing
this course he brought to bear the power of his now
immense reputation for wisdom and justice. Perhaps
no other phase of his life displays more strikingly
his intense conservatism.</p>

<p>The conclusion of his early manhood&mdash;reluctantly
avowed after Washington, following the Revolution,
had bitterly expressed the same opinion,<a name="FNanchor_1326_1326" id="FNanchor_1326_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a>
that the people, left to themselves, are not capable
of self-government&mdash;had now become a profound
moral belief. It should again be stated that most of
Marshall's views, formed as a young lawyer during
the riotous years between the achievement of Independence
and the adoption of the Constitution,
had hardened, as life advanced, into something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
like religious convictions. It is noteworthy, too,
that, in general, Madison, Giles, and even Monroe,
now stood with Marshall.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous feature of those fourteen
weeks of tumultuous contest, as far as it reveals
Marshall's personal standing in Virginia, was the
trust, reverence, and affection in which he was held
by all members, young and old, radical and conservative,
from every part of the State. Speaker after
speaker, even in the fiercest debates, went out of
his way to pay tribute to Marshall's uprightness
and wisdom.<a name="FNanchor_1327_1327" id="FNanchor_1327_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a></p>

<p>Marshall spoke frequently on the Judiciary; and,
at one point in a debate on the removal of judges,
disclosed opinions of historical importance. Although
twenty-seven years had passed since the repeal
of the Federalist Judiciary Act of 1801,<a name="FNanchor_1328_1328" id="FNanchor_1328_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_1328_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a> Marshall
would not, even now, admit that repeal to be
Constitutional. Littleton W. Tazewell, also a mem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>ber
of the Judiciary Committee, asserted that, under
the proposed new State Constitution, the Legislature
could remove judges from office by abolishing
the courts. John Scott of Fauquier County asked
Marshall what he thought of the ousting of Federalist
judges by the Republicans in 1802.</p>

<p>The Chief Justice answered, "with great, very
great repugnance," that throughout the debate he
had "most carefully avoided" expressing any opinion
on that subject. He would say, however, that
"he did not conceive the Constitution to have been
at all definitely expounded by a single act of Congress."
Especially when "there was no union of
Departments, but the Legislative Department alone
had acted, and acted but once," ignoring the Judicial
Department, such an act, "even admitting that
act not to have passed in times of high political and
party excitement, could never be admitted as final
and conclusive."<a name="FNanchor_1329_1329" id="FNanchor_1329_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1329_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a></p>

<p>Tazewell was of "an exactly opposite opinion"&mdash;the
Repeal Act of 1802 "was perfectly constitutional
and proper." Giles also disagreed with
Marshall. Should "a public officer ... receive the
public money any longer than he renders service to
the public"?<a name="FNanchor_1330_1330" id="FNanchor_1330_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1330_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a> Marshall replied with spirit. No
serious question can be settled, he declared, by
mere "confidence of conviction, but on the reason
of the case." All that he asked was that the Judiciary
Article of the proposed State Constitution should
go forth, "uninfluenced by the opinion of any individual:
let those, whose duty it was to settle the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
interpretation of the Constitution, decide on the
Constitution itself."<a name="FNanchor_1331_1331" id="FNanchor_1331_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a> After extended debate<a name="FNanchor_1332_1332" id="FNanchor_1332_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1332_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a> and
some wrangling, Marshall's idea on this particular
phase of the subject prevailed.<a name="FNanchor_1333_1333" id="FNanchor_1333_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1333_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a></p>

<p>The debate over the preservation of the County
Court system, for which Marshall's report provided,
was long and acrimonious, and a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of it is
impossible here. Marshall stoutly supported these
local tribunals; their "abolition will affect our whole
internal police.... No State in the Union, has
hitherto enjoyed more complete internal quiet than
Virginia. There is no part of America, where ... less
of ill-feeling between man and man is to be found
than in this Commonwealth, and I believe most
firmly that this state of things is mainly to be
ascribed to the practical operation of our County
Courts." The county judges "consist in general of
the best men in their respective counties. They act
in the spirit of peace-makers, and allay, rather than
excite the small disputes ... which will sometimes
arise among neighbours."<a name="FNanchor_1334_1334" id="FNanchor_1334_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a></p>

<p>Giles now aligned himself with Marshall as a
champion of the County Court system. In an
earnest defense of it he went so far as to reflect on
the good sense of Jefferson. Everybody, said Giles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
knew that that "highly respectable man ... dealt
very much in theories."<a name="FNanchor_1335_1335" id="FNanchor_1335_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a></p>

<p>During the remainder of the discussion on this
subject, Marshall rose frequently, chiefly, however,
to guide the debate.<a name="FNanchor_1336_1336" id="FNanchor_1336_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a> He insisted that the custom
of appointing justices of the peace only on nomination
of the County Courts should be written
into the constitution. The Executive ought to
appoint <i>all</i> persons recommended by "a County
Court, taken as a whole." Marshall then moved an
amendment to that effect.<a name="FNanchor_1337_1337" id="FNanchor_1337_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a></p>

<p>This was a far more conservative idea than was
contained in the old constitution itself. "Let the
County Court who now recommended, have power
also to appoint: for there it ended at last," said
William Campbell of Bedford County. Giles was
for Marshall's plan: "The existing County Court
system" threw "power into the hands of the middle
class of the community," he said; and it ought to
be fortified rather than weakened.</p>

<p>Marshall then withdrew his astonishing amendment
and proposed, instead, that the advice and
"consent of the Senate" should not be required for
appointments of county justices, thus utterly eliminating
all legislative control over these important
appointments; and this extreme conservative proposition
was actually adopted without dissent.<a name="FNanchor_1338_1338" id="FNanchor_1338_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a> Thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
the very foundation of Virginia's aristocratic political
organization was greatly strengthened.</p>

<p>Concerning the retention of his office by a judge
after the court had been abolished, Marshall made
an earnest and impressive speech. What were the
duties of a judge? "He has to pass between the
Government and the man whom that Government
is prosecuting: between the most powerful individual
in the community, and the poorest and most unpopular.
It is of the last importance, that in the
exercise of these duties, he should observe the utmost
fairness. Need I press the necessity of this?
Does not every man feel that his own personal security
and the security of his property depends on
that fairness?</p>

<p>"The Judicial Department comes home in its effects
to every man's fireside: it passes on his property,
his reputation, his life, his all. Is it not, to the
last degree important, that he should be rendered
perfectly and completely independent, with nothing
to influence or control him but God and his conscience?</p>

<p>"You do not allow a man to perform the duties of
a juryman or a Judge, if he has one dollar of interest
in the matter to be decided: and will you allow a
Judge to give a decision when his office may depend
upon it? when his decision may offend a powerful
and influential man?</p>

<p>"Your salaries do not allow any of your Judges
to lay up for his old age: the longer he remains
in office, the more dependant he becomes upon his
office. He wishes to retain it; if he did not wish to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
retain it, he would not have accepted it. And will
you make me believe that if the manner of his decision
may affect the tenure of that office, the man
himself will not be affected by that consideration?...
The whole good which may grow out of this Convention,
be it what it may, will never compensate
for the evil of changing the tenure of the Judicial
office."</p>

<p>Barbour had said that to presume that the Legislature
would oust judges because of unpopular decisions,
was to make an unthinkable imputation.
But "for what do you make a Constitution?"
countered Marshall. Why provide that "no bill of
attainder, or an <i>ex post facto</i> law, shall be passed?
What a calumny is here upon the Legislature,"
he sarcastically exclaimed. "Do you believe, that
the Legislature will pass a bill of attainder, or an <i>ex
post facto</i> law? Do you believe, that they will pass
a law impairing the obligation of contracts? If not,
why provide against it?...</p>

<p>"You declare, that the Legislature shall not take
private property for the public use, without just
compensation. Do you believe, that the Legislature
will put forth their grasp upon private property,
without compensation? Certainly I do not. There
is as little reason to believe they will do such an act
as this, as there is to believe, that a Legislature will
offend against a Judge who has given a decision
against some favourite opinion and favourite measure
of theirs, or against a popular individual who
has almost led the Legislature by his talents and
influence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am persuaded, there is at least as much danger
that they will lay hold on such an individual, as
that they will condemn a man to death for doing
that which, when he committed it, was no crime.
The gentleman says, it is impossible the Legislature
should ever think of doing such a thing. Why
then expunge the prohibition?... This Convention
can do nothing that would entail a more serious evil
upon Virginia, than to destroy the tenure by which
her Judges hold their offices."<a name="FNanchor_1339_1339" id="FNanchor_1339_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a></p>

<p>An hour later, the Chief Justice again addressed
the convention on the independence of the Judiciary.
Tazewell had spoken much in the vein of the Republicans
of 1802.<a name="FNanchor_1340_1340" id="FNanchor_1340_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a> "The independence of all those
who try causes between man and man, and between
a man and his Government," answered Marshall,
"can be maintained only by the tenure of their
office. Is not their independence preserved under
the present system? None can doubt it. Such an
idea was never heard of in Virginia, as to remove a
Judge from office." Suppose the courts at the mercy
of the Legislature? "What would then be the condition
of the court, should the Legislature prosecute
a man, with an earnest wish to convict him?... If
they may be removed at pleasure, will any lawyer
of distinction come upon your bench?</p>

<p>"No, Sir. I have always thought, from my earliest
youth till now, that the greatest scourge an angry
Heaven ever inflicted upon an ungrateful and a
sinning people, was an ignorant, a corrupt, or a
dependent Judiciary. Will you draw down this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
curse upon Virginia? Our ancestors thought so: we
thought so till very lately; and I trust the vote of
this day will shew that we think so still."<a name="FNanchor_1341_1341" id="FNanchor_1341_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a></p>

<p>Seldom in any parliamentary body has an appeal
been so fruitful of votes. Marshall's idea of the
inviolability of judicial tenure was sustained by a
vote of 56 to 29, Madison voting with him.<a name="FNanchor_1342_1342" id="FNanchor_1342_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1342_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a></p>

<p>Lucas P. Thompson of Amherst County moved
to strike out the provision in Marshall's Judiciary
Article that the abolition of a court should not
"deprive any Judge thereof of his office."<a name="FNanchor_1343_1343" id="FNanchor_1343_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a> Thus
the direct question, so fiercely debated in Congress
twenty-seven years earlier,<a name="FNanchor_1344_1344" id="FNanchor_1344_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_1344_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a> was brought before
the convention. It was promptly decided, and
against the views and action of Jefferson and the
Republicans of 1802. By a majority of 8 out of a
total of 96,<a name="FNanchor_1345_1345" id="FNanchor_1345_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a> the convention sustained the old
Federalist idea that judges should continue to
hold their positions and receive their salaries, even
though their offices were abolished.</p>

<p>Before the vote was taken, however, a sharp debate
occurred between Marshall and Giles. To
keep judges in office, although that office be destroyed,
"was nothing less than to establish a privileged
corps in a free community," said Giles.
Marshall had said "that a Judge ought to be responsible
only to God and to his own conscience."
Although "one of the first objects in view, in calling
this Convention, was to make the Judges responsible&mdash;not
nominally, but really responsible," Marshall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
actually proposed to establish "a <i>privileged order</i> of
men." Another part of Marshall's plan, said Giles,
required the concurrent vote of both Houses of the
Legislature to remove a judge from the bench.
"This was inserted, for what?" To prevent the
Legislature from removing a judge "whenever his
conduct had been such, that he became unpopular
and odious to the people"&mdash;the very power the
Legislature ought to have.<a name="FNanchor_1346_1346" id="FNanchor_1346_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a></p>

<p>In reply, Marshall said that he would not, at that
time, discuss the removal of judges by the Legislature,
but would confine himself "directly to the object
before him," as to whether the abolition of a
court should not deprive the judge of his office.
Giles had fallen into a strange confusion&mdash;he had
treated "the office of a Judge, and the Court in
which he sat, as being ... indissolubly united." But,
asked Marshall, were the words "office and Court
synonymes"? By no means. The proposed Judiciary
Article makes the distinction when it declares
that though the <i>court</i> be abolished, the judge still
holds his <i>office</i>. "In what does the office of a Judge
consist? ... in his constitutional capacity to receive
Judicial power, and to perform Judicial Duties....</p>

<p>"If the Constitution shall declare that when the
court is abolished, he shall still hold" his office,
"there is no inconsistency in the declaration....
What creates the office?" An election to it by the
Legislature and a commission by the Governor.
"When these acts have been performed, the Judges
are in office. Now, if the Constitution shall say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
that his office shall continue, and he shall perform
Judicial duties, though his court may be abolished,
does he, because of any modification that may be
made in that court, cease to be a Judge?...</p>

<p>"The question constantly recurs&mdash;do you mean
that the Judges shall be removable at the will of the
Legislature? The gentleman talks of responsibility.
Responsibility to what? to the will of the Legislature?
can there be no responsibility, unless your
Judges shall be removable at pleasure? will nothing
short of this satisfy gentlemen? Then, indeed, there
is an end to independence. The tenure during good
behaviour, is a mere imposition on the public belief&mdash;a
sound that is kept to the ear&mdash;and nothing
else. The consequences must present themselves to
every mind. There can be no member of this body
who does not feel them.</p>

<p>"If your Judges are to be removable at the will of
the Legislature, all that you look for from fidelity,
from knowledge, from capacity, is gone and gone
forever." Seldom did Marshall show more feeling
than when pressing this point; he could not "sit
down," he said, without "noticing the morality" of
giving the Legislature power to remove judges from
office. "Gentlemen talk of sinecures, and privileged
orders&mdash;with a view, as it would seem, to cast
odium on those who are in office.</p>

<p>"You seduce a lawyer from his practice, by which
he is earning a comfortable independence, by promising
him a certain support for life, unless he shall be
guilty of misconduct in his office. And after thus
seducing him, when his independence is gone, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
the means of supporting his family relinquished,
you will suffer him to be displaced and turned loose
on the world with the odious brand of sinecure-pensioner&mdash;privileged
order&mdash;put upon him, as
a lazy drone who seeks to live upon the labour of
others. This is the course you are asked to pursue."</p>

<p>The provisions of the Judiciary Article before
the convention secure ample responsibility. "If not,
they can be made [to do] so. But is it not new doctrine
to declare, that the Legislature by merely
changing the name of a court or the place of its meeting,
may remove any Judge from his office? The
question to be decided is, and it is one to which we
must come, whether the Judges shall be permanent
in their office, or shall be dependent altogether upon
the breath of the Legislature."<a name="FNanchor_1347_1347" id="FNanchor_1347_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1347_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a></p>

<p>Giles answered on the instant. In doing so, he
began by a tribute to Marshall's "standing and personal
excellence" which were so great "that he was
willing to throw himself into the background, as to
any weight to be attached to his [Giles's] own opinion."
Therefore, he would "rely exclusively on the
merits" of the controversy. Marshall had not shown
"that it was not an anomaly to have the court out
of being, and an office pertain[ing] to the court in
being.... It was an anomaly in terms."</p>

<p>Giles "had, however, such high respect" for Marshall's
standing, "that he always doubted his own
opinion when put in opposition" to that of the Chief
Justice. He had not intended, he avowed, "to throw
reproach upon the Judges in office." Far be it from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
him to reflect "in the least degree on their honour
and integrity." His point was that, by Marshall's
plan, "responsibility was rather avoided than sought
to be secured." Giles was willing to risk his liberty
thus far&mdash;"if a Judge became odious to the people,
let him be removed from office."<a name="FNanchor_1348_1348" id="FNanchor_1348_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a></p>

<p>The debate continued upon another amendment
by Thompson. Viewing the contest as a sheer struggle
of minds, the conservatives were superior to the
reformers,<a name="FNanchor_1349_1349" id="FNanchor_1349_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a> and steadily they gained votes.<a name="FNanchor_1350_1350" id="FNanchor_1350_1350"></a><a href="#Footnote_1350_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a></p>

<p>Again Marshall spoke, this time crossing swords
with Benjamin W. S. Cabell and James Madison,
over a motion of the former that judges whose courts
were abolished, and to whom the Legislature assigned
no new duties, should not receive salaries: "There
were upwards of one hundred Inferior Courts in Virginia....
No gentleman could look at the dockets of
these courts, and possibly think" that the judges
would ever have no business to transact.</p>

<p>Cabell's amendment "stated an impossible case,"
said Marshall,&mdash;a "case where there should be no
controversies between man and man, and no crimes
committed against society. It stated a case that
could not happen&mdash;and would the convention
encounter the real hazard of putting almost every
Judge in the Commonwealth in the power of the
Legislature, for the sake of providing for an impossible
case?"<a name="FNanchor_1351_1351" id="FNanchor_1351_1351"></a><a href="#Footnote_1351_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a> But in spite of Marshall's opposition,
Cabell's amendment was adopted by a vote of 59<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
to 36.<a name="FNanchor_1352_1352" id="FNanchor_1352_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a> Two weeks later, however, the convention reversed
itself by two curious and contradictory votes.<a name="FNanchor_1353_1353" id="FNanchor_1353_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1353_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a>
So in the end Marshall won.</p>

<p>The subject of the Judiciary did not seriously
arise again until the vote on the adoption of the
entire constitution was imminent. As it turned
out, the constitution, when adopted, contained, in
substance, the Judiciary provisions which Marshall
had written and reported at the beginning of that
body's deliberations.<a name="FNanchor_1354_1354" id="FNanchor_1354_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a></p>

<p>The other and the commanding problem, for the
solution of which the contention had been called,
was made up of the associated questions of suffrage,
taxation, and representation. Broadly speaking, the
issue was that of white manhood suffrage and representation
based upon the enumeration of whites, as
against suffrage determined by property and taxation,
representation to be based on an enumeration
which included three fifths of the slave population.<a name="FNanchor_1355_1355" id="FNanchor_1355_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a></p>

<p>In these complex and tangled questions the State
and the convention were divided; so fierce were the
contending factions, and so diverse were opinions on
various elements of the confused problem, especially
among those demanding reform, that at times no
solution seemed possible. The friends of reform were
fairly well organized and co&ouml;perated in a spirit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
unity uncommon to liberals. But, as generally happens,
the conservatives had much better discipline,
far more harmony of opinion and conduct. The
debate on both sides was able and brilliant.<a name="FNanchor_1356_1356" id="FNanchor_1356_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a></p>

<p>Finally the convention seemingly became deadlocked.
Each side declared it would not yield.<a name="FNanchor_1357_1357" id="FNanchor_1357_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a> Then
came the inevitable reaction&mdash;a spirit of conciliation
mellowed everybody. Sheer human nature,
wearied of strife, sought the escape that mutual accommodation
alone afforded. The moment came for
which Marshall had been patiently waiting. Rising
slowly, as was his wont, until his great height seemed
to the convention to be increased, his soothing voice,
in the very gentleness of its timbre, gave a sense of
restfulness and agreement so grateful to, and so desired
by, even the sternest of the combatants.</p>

<p>"No person in the House," began the Chief Justice,
"can be more truly gratified than I am, at
seeing the spirit that has been manifested here to-day;
and it is my earnest wish that this spirit of
conciliation may be acted upon in a fair, equal and
honest manner, adapted to the situation of the different
parts of the Commonwealth, which are to be
affected."</p>

<p>The warring factions, said Marshall, were at last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
in substantial accord. "That the Federal numbers
[the enumeration of slaves as fixed in the National
Constitution] and the plan of the white basis shall be
blended together so as to allow each an equal portion
of power, seems to be very generally agreed to."
The only difference now was that one faction insisted
on applying this plan to both Houses of the
Legislature, while the other faction would restrict
the white basis to the popular branch, leaving the
Senate to be chosen on the combined free white and
black slave enumeration.</p>

<p>This involves the whole theory of property. One
gentleman, in particular, "seems to imagine that we
claim nothing of republican principles, when we claim
a representation for property." But "republican
principles" do not depend on "the naked principle
of numbers." On the contrary, "the soundest principles
of republicanism do sanction some relation
between representation and taxation.... The two
ought to be connected.... This was the principle of
the revolution.... This basis of Representation is ...
so important to Virginia" that everybody had
thought about it before this convention was called.</p>

<p>"Several different plans were contemplated. The
basis of white population alone; the basis of free
population alone; a basis of population alone; a basis
compounded of taxation and white population, (or
which is the same thing, a basis of Federal numbers:)....
Now, of these various propositions, the basis of
white population, and the basis of taxation alone are
the two extremes." But, "between the free population,
and the white population, there is almost no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
difference: Between the basis of total population and
the basis of taxation, there is but little difference."</p>

<p>Frankly and without the least disguise of his opinions,
Marshall admitted that he was a conservative
of conservatives: "The people of the East," of
whom he avowed himself to be one, "thought that
they offered a fair compromise, when they proposed
the compound basis of population and taxation,
or the basis of the Federal numbers. We thought
that we had republican precedent for this&mdash;a precedent
given us by the wisest and truest patriots that
ever were assembled: but that is now past.</p>

<p>"We are now willing to meet on a new middle
ground." Between the two extremes "the majority
is too small to calculate upon.... We are all uncertain
as to the issue. But all know this, that if either extreme
is carried, it must leave a wound in the breast
of the opposite party which will fester and rankle,
and produce I know not what mischief." The conservatives
were now the majority of the convention,
yet they were again willing to make concessions.
Avoiding both extremes, Marshall proposed, "as a
compromise," that the basis of representation "shall
be made according to an exact compound of the two
principles, of the white basis and of the Federal numbers,
according to the Census of 1820."<a name="FNanchor_1358_1358" id="FNanchor_1358_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a></p>

<p>Further debate ensued, during which animosity
seemed about to come to life again, when the Chief
Justice once more exerted his mollifying influence.
"Two propositions respecting the basis of Representation
have divided this Convention almost equally,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
he said. "The question has been discussed, until
discussion has become useless. It has been argued,
until argument is exhausted. We have now met on
the ground of compromise." It is no longer a matter
of the triumph of either side. The only consideration
now is whether the convention can agree on some
plan to lay before the people "with a reasonable hope
that it may be adopted. Some concession must be
made on both sides.... What is the real situation of
the parties?" Unquestionably both are sincere. "To
attempt now to throw considerations of principle
into either scale, is to add fuel to a flame which it is
our purpose to extinguish. We must lose sight of
the situation of parties and state of opinion, if we
make this attempt."</p>

<p>The convention is nearly evenly balanced. At
this moment those favoring a white basis only have
a trembling majority of two. This may change&mdash;the
reversal of a single vote would leave the House
"equally divided."</p>

<p>The question must be decided "one way or the
other"; but, if either faction prevails by a bare
majority, the proposed constitution will go to the
people from an almost equally divided convention.
That means a tremendous struggle, a riven State.
Interests in certain parts of the Commonwealth will
surely resist "with great force" a purely white basis
of representation, especially if no effective property
qualification for suffrage is provided. This opposition
is absolutely certain "unless human nature
shall cease to be what it has been in all time."</p>

<p>No human power can forecast the result of further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
contest. But one thing is certain: "To obtain a just
compromise, concession must not only be mutual&mdash;it
must be equal also.... Each ought to concede to
the other as much as he demands from that other....
There can be no hope that either will yield more than
it gets in return."</p>

<p>The proposal that white population and taxation
"mixed" with Federal numbers in "equal proportions"
shall "form the basis of Representation in
both Houses," is equal and just. "All feel it to be
equal." Yet the conservatives now go still further&mdash;they
are willing to place the House on the white basis
and apply the mixed basis to the Senate only. Why
refuse this adjustment? Plainly it will work well for
everybody: "If the Senate would protect the East,
will it not protect the West also?"</p>

<p>Marshall's satisfaction was "inexpressible" when
he heard from both sides the language of conciliation.
"I hailed these auspicious appearances with
as much joy, as the inhabitant of the polar regions
hails the re-appearance of the sun after his long absence
of six tedious months. Can these appearances
prove fallacious? Is it a meteor we have seen and
mistaken for that splendid luminary which dispenses
light and gladness throughout creation? It must be
so, if we cannot meet on equal ground. If we cannot
meet on the line that divides us equally, then take
the hand of friendship, and make an equal compromise;
it is vain to hope that any compromise can be
made."<a name="FNanchor_1359_1359" id="FNanchor_1359_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a></p>

<p>The basis of representation does not appear in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
constitution, the number of Senators and Representatives
being arbitrarily fixed by districts and counties;
but this plan, in reality, gave the slaveholding
sections almost the same preponderance over the
comparatively non-slaveholding sections as would
have resulted from the enumeration of three fifths
of all slaves in addition to all whites.<a name="FNanchor_1360_1360" id="FNanchor_1360_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a></p>

<p>While the freehold principle was abandoned, as
Marshall foresaw that it would be, the principle of
property qualification as against manhood suffrage
was triumphant.<a name="FNanchor_1361_1361" id="FNanchor_1361_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a> With a majority against them,
the conservatives won by better management, assisted
by the personal influence of the Chief Justice,
to which, on most phases of the struggle, was added
that of Madison and Giles.</p>

<p>Nearly a century has passed since these happenings,
and Marshall's attitude now appears to have
been that of cold reaction; but he was as honest as
he was outspoken in his resistance to democratic reforms.
He wanted good government, safe government.
He was not in the least concerned in the rule
of the people as such. Indeed, he believed that the
more they directly controlled public affairs the worse
the business of government would be conducted.</p>

<p>He feared that sheer majorities would be unjust,
intolerant, tyrannical; and he was certain that they
would be untrustworthy and freakishly changeable.
These convictions would surely have dictated his
course in the Virginia Constitutional Convention of
1829-30, had no other considerations influenced him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span></p>

<p>But, in addition to his long settled and ever-petrifying
conservative views, we must also take into
account the conditions and public temper existing
in Virginia ninety years ago. Had the convention
reached any other conclusion than that to which
Marshall gently guided it, it is certain that the State
would have been torn by dissension, and it is not
improbable that there would have been bloodshed.
All things considered, it seems unsafe to affirm
that Marshall's course was not the wisest for that
immediate period and for that particular State.</p>

<p>Displaying no vision, no aspiration, no devotion
to human rights, he merely acted the uninspiring
but necessary part of the practical statesman dealing
with an existing and a very grave situation. If
Jefferson could be so frightened in 1816 that he forbade
the public circulation of his perfectly sound
views on the wretched Virginia Constitution of 1776,<a name="FNanchor_1362_1362" id="FNanchor_1362_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a>
can it be wondered at that the conservative Marshall
in 1830 wished to compose the antagonisms
of the warring factions?</p>

<p>The fact that the Nation was then facing the
possibility of dissolution<a name="FNanchor_1363_1363" id="FNanchor_1363_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a> must also be taken into
account. That circumstance, indeed, influenced
Marshall even more than did his profound conservatism.
There can be little doubt that, had either
the radicals or the conservatives achieved an outright
victory, one part of Virginia would have separated
from the other and the growing sentiment
for disunion would have received a powerful impulse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span></p>

<p>Hurrying from Richmond to Washington when
the convention adjourned, Marshall listened to the
argument of Craig <i>vs.</i> Missouri; and then delivered
one of the strongest opinions he ever wrote&mdash;the
only one of his Constitutional expositions to be
entirely repudiated by the Supreme Court after his
death. The case grew out of the financial conditions
described in the fourth chapter of this volume.</p>

<p>When Missouri became a State in 1821, her people
found themselves in desperate case. There was no
money. Banks had suspended, and specie had been
drained to the Eastern commercial centers. The
simplest business transactions were difficult, almost
impossible. Even taxes could not be paid. The Legislature,
therefore, established loan offices where
citizens, by giving promissory notes, secured by
mortgage or pledge of personal property, could purchase
loan certificates issued by the State. These
certificates were receivable for taxes and other public
debts and for salt from the State salt mines.
The faith and resources of Missouri were pledged
for the redemption of the certificates which were
negotiable and issued in denominations not exceeding
ten dollars or less than fifty cents. In effect and
in intention, the State thus created a local circulating
medium of exchange.</p>

<p>On August 1, 1822, Hiram Craig and two others
gave their promissory notes for $199.99 in payment
for loan certificates. On maturity of these notes the
borrowers refused to pay, and the State sued them;
judgment against them was rendered in the trial
court and this judgment was affirmed by the Su<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>preme
Court of Missouri. The case was taken, by
writ of error, to the Supreme Court of the United
States, where the sole question to be decided was
the constitutionality of the Missouri loan office
statutes.</p>

<p>Marshall's associates were now Johnson, Duval,
Story, Thompson, McLean, and Baldwin; the last
two recently appointed by Jackson. It was becoming
apparent that the court was growing restive
under the rigid practice of the austere theory of
government and business which the Chief Justice
had maintained for nearly a generation. This tendency
was shown in this case by the stand taken
by three of the Associate Justices. Marshall was
in his seventy-sixth year, but never did his genius
shine more resplendently than in his announcement
of the opinion of the Supreme Court in Craig <i>vs.</i>
Missouri.<a name="FNanchor_1364_1364" id="FNanchor_1364_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a></p>

<p>He held that the Missouri loan certificates were
bills of credit, which the National Constitution
prohibited any State to issue. "What is a bill of
credit?" It is "any instrument by which a state engages
to pay money at a future day; thus including
a certificate given for money borrowed.... To 'emit
bills of credit' conveys to the mind the idea of issuing
paper intended to circulate through the community,
for its ordinary purposes, as money, which
paper is redeemable at a future day."<a name="FNanchor_1365_1365" id="FNanchor_1365_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a> The Chief
Justice goes into the history of the paper money evil
that caused the framers of the Constitution to forbid
the States to "emit bills of credit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span></p>

<p>Such currency always fluctuates. "Its value is
continually changing; and these changes, often great
and sudden, expose individuals to immense loss,
are the sources of ruinous speculations, and destroy
all confidence between man and man." To "cut up
this mischief by the roots ... the people declared, in
their Constitution, that no state should emit bills
of credit. If the prohibition means anything, if the
words are not empty sounds, it must comprehend
the emission of any paper medium by a state government,
for the purpose of common circulation."<a name="FNanchor_1366_1366" id="FNanchor_1366_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a></p>

<p>Incontestably the Missouri loan certificates are
just such bills of credit. Indeed, the State law itself
"speaks of them in this character." That the statute
calls them certificates instead of bills of credit
does not change the fact. How absurd to claim that
the Constitution "meant to prohibit names and not
things! That a very important act, big with great
and ruinous mischief, which is expressly forbidden ... may
be performed by the substitution of a name."
The Constitution is not to be evaded "by giving a
new name to an old thing."<a name="FNanchor_1367_1367" id="FNanchor_1367_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a></p>

<p>It is nonsense to say that these particular bills of
credit are lawful because they are not made legal
tender, since a separate provision applies to legal
tender. The issue of legal tender currency, and also
bills of credit, is equally and separately forbidden:
"To sustain the one because it is not also the other;
to say that bills of credit may be emitted if they be
not made a tender in payment of debts; is ... to
expunge that distinct, independent prohibition."<a name="FNanchor_1368_1368" id="FNanchor_1368_1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_1368_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span></p>

<p>In a well-nigh perfect historical summary, Marshall
reviews experiments before and during the Revolution
in bills of credit that were made legal tender,
and in others that were not&mdash;all "productive of
the same effects," all equally ruinous in results.<a name="FNanchor_1369_1369" id="FNanchor_1369_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1369_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a>
The Missouri law authorizing the loan certificates,
for which Craig gave his promissory note, is "against
the highest law of the land, and ... the note itself
is utterly void."<a name="FNanchor_1370_1370" id="FNanchor_1370_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1370_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a></p>

<p>The Chief Justice closes with a brief paragraph
splendid in its simple dignity and power. In his argument
for Missouri, Senator Thomas H. Benton
had used violent language of the kind frequently
employed by the champions of State Rights: "If ... the
character of a sovereign State shall be impugned,"
he cried, "contests about civil rights would
be settled amid the din of arms, rather than in these
halls of national justice."<a name="FNanchor_1371_1371" id="FNanchor_1371_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a></p>

<p>To this outburst Marshall replies: The court has
been told of "the dangers which may result from"
offending a sovereign State. If obedience to the
Constitution and laws of the Nation "shall be calculated
to bring on those dangers ... or if it shall
be indispensable to the preservation of the union,
and consequently of the independence and liberty
of these states; these are considerations which address
themselves to those departments which may
with perfect propriety be influenced by them. This
department can listen only to the mandates of law;
and can tread only that path which is marked out
by duty."<a name="FNanchor_1372_1372" id="FNanchor_1372_1372"></a><a href="#Footnote_1372_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span></p>

<p>In this noble passage Marshall is not only rebuking
Benton; he is also speaking to the advocates
of Nullification, then becoming clamorous and threatening;
he is pointing out to Andrew Jackson the path
of duty.<a name="FNanchor_1373_1373" id="FNanchor_1373_1373"></a><a href="#Footnote_1373_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a></p>

<p>Justices Johnson, Thompson, and McLean afterwards
filed dissenting opinions, thus beginning the
departure, within the Supreme Court, from the
stern Constitutional Nationalism of Marshall. This
breach in the court deeply troubled the Chief Justice
during the remaining four years of his life.</p>

<p>Johnson thought "that these certificates are of
a truly amphibious character." The Missouri law
"does indeed approach as near to a violation of the
Constitution as it can well go without violating its
prohibition, but it is in the exercise of an unquestionable
right, although in rather a questionable
form." So, on the whole, Johnson concluded that
the Supreme Court had better hold the statute
valid.<a name="FNanchor_1374_1374" id="FNanchor_1374_1374"></a><a href="#Footnote_1374_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a></p>

<p>"The right of a State to borrow money cannot be
questioned," said Thompson; that is all the Missouri
scheme amounts to. If these loan certificates
are bills of credit, so are "all bank notes, issued either
by the States, or under their authority."<a name="FNanchor_1375_1375" id="FNanchor_1375_1375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1375_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a> Justice
McLean pointed out that Craig's case was only one
of many of the same kind. "The solemn act of a
State ... cannot be set aside ... under a doubtful
construction of the Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_1376_1376" id="FNanchor_1376_1376"></a><a href="#Footnote_1376_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a>... It would be as
gross usurpation on the part of the federal govern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>ment
to interfere with State rights by an exercise
of powers not delegated, as it would be for a State
to interpose its authority against a law of the
Union."<a name="FNanchor_1377_1377" id="FNanchor_1377_1377"></a><a href="#Footnote_1377_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a></p>

<p>In Congress attacks upon Marshall and the Supreme
Court now were renewed&mdash;but they grew
continuously feebler. At the first session after the
decision of the Missouri loan certificate case, a bill
was introduced to repeal the provision of the Judiciary
Act upon which the National powers of
the Supreme Court so largely depended. "If the
twenty-fifth section is repealed, the Constitution
is practically gone," declared Story. "Our wisest
friends look with great gloom to the future."<a name="FNanchor_1378_1378" id="FNanchor_1378_1378"></a><a href="#Footnote_1378_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a></p>

<p>Marshall was equally despondent, but his political
vision was clearer. When he read the dissenting
opinions of Johnson, Thompson, and McLean, he
wrote Story: "It requires no prophet to predict
that the 25th section [of the Judiciary Act] is to
be repealed, or to use a more fashionable phrase
to be nullified by the Supreme Court of the United
States."<a name="FNanchor_1379_1379" id="FNanchor_1379_1379"></a><a href="#Footnote_1379_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a> He realized clearly that the great tribunal,
the power and dignity of which he had done
so much to create, would soon be brought under
the control of those who, for some years at least,
would reject that broad and vigorous Nationalism
which he had steadily and effectively asserted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
during almost a third of a century. One more vacancy
on the Supreme Bench and a single new appointment
by Jackson would give the court to
the opponents of Marshall's views. Before he died,
the Chief Justice was to behold two such vacancies.<a name="FNanchor_1380_1380" id="FNanchor_1380_1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1380_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a></p>

<p>On January 24, 1831, William R. Davis of South
Carolina presented the majority report of the
Judiciary Committee favoring the repeal of that
section of the Judiciary Act under which the Supreme
Court had demolished State laws and annihilated
the decisions of State courts.<a name="FNanchor_1381_1381" id="FNanchor_1381_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a> James
Buchanan presented the minority report.<a name="FNanchor_1382_1382" id="FNanchor_1382_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1382_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a> A few
minutes' preliminary discussion revealed the deep
feeling on both sides. Philip Doddridge of Virginia
declared that the bill was of "as much importance
as if it were a proposition to repeal the Union of
these States." William W. Ellsworth of Connecticut
avowed that it was of "overwhelming magnitude."<a name="FNanchor_1383_1383" id="FNanchor_1383_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1383_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a></p>

<p>Thereupon the subject was furiously debated.
Thomas H. Crawford of Pennsylvania considered
Section 25 of the Judiciary Act, to be as "sacred"
as the Constitution itself.<a name="FNanchor_1384_1384" id="FNanchor_1384_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_1384_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a> Henry Daniel of Kentucky
asserted that the Supreme Court "stops at
nothing to obtain power." Let the "States ... prepare
for the worst, and protect themselves against
the assaults of this gigantic tribunal."<a name="FNanchor_1385_1385" id="FNanchor_1385_1385"></a><a href="#Footnote_1385_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a></p>

<p>William Fitzhugh Gordon of Virginia, recently
elected, but already a member of the Judiciary Com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>mittee,
stoutly defended the report of the majority:
"When a committee of the House had given to a subject
the calmest and maturest investigation, and a
motion is made to print their report, a gentleman
gets up, and, in a tone of alarm, denounces the proposition
as tantamount to a motion to repeal the
Union." Gordon repudiated the very thought of
dismemberment of the Republic&mdash;that "palladium
of our hopes, and of the liberties of mankind."</p>

<p>As to the constitutionality of Section 25 of the
Judiciary Act&mdash;"could it be new, especially to a
Virginia lawyer"? when the Virginia Judiciary, with
Roane at its head, had solemnly proclaimed the illegality
of that section. And had not Georgia ordered
her Governor to resist the enforcement of that provision
of that ancient act of Congress? "I declare to
God ... that I believe nothing would tend so much
to compose the present agitation of the country ... as
the repeal of that portion of the judiciary act."
Gordon was about to discuss the nefarious case of
Cohens <i>vs.</i> Virginia when his emotions overcame him&mdash;"he
did not wish ... to go into the merits of the
question."<a name="FNanchor_1386_1386" id="FNanchor_1386_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a></p>

<p>Thomas F. Foster of Georgia said that the Judiciary
Committee had reported under a "galling fire
from the press"; quoted Marshall's unfortunate
language in the Convention of 1788;<a name="FNanchor_1387_1387" id="FNanchor_1387_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a> and insisted
that the "vast and alarming" powers of the Supreme
Court must be bridled.<a name="FNanchor_1388_1388" id="FNanchor_1388_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span></p>

<p>But the friends of the court overwhelmed the supporters
of the bill, which was rejected by a vote of
138 to 51.<a name="FNanchor_1389_1389" id="FNanchor_1389_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a> It was ominous, however, that the South
stood almost solid against the court and Nationalism.</p>

immediately after the House had elected John Quincy Adams
to the Presidency, Marshall writes his brother a letter full of political
gossip. He is surprised that Adams was chosen on the first ballot;
many think Kremer's letter attacking Clay caused this unexpectedly
quick decision, since it "was &amp; is thought a sheer calumny; &amp; the resentment
of Clay's friends probably determined some of the western
members who were hesitating. It is supposed to have had some influence
elsewhere. The vote of New York was not decided five minutes
before the ballots were taken."
</p><p>
Marshall tells his brother about Cabinet rumors&mdash;Crawford has
refused the Treasury and Clay has been offered the office of Secretary
of State. "It is meer [<i>sic</i>] common rumor" that Clay will accept.
"Mr. Adams will undoubtedly wish to strengthen himself in the west,"
and Clay is strong in that section unless Kremer's letter has weakened
him. The Chief Justice at first thought it had, but "on reflection"
doubts whether it will "make any difference." (Marshall to his brother,
Feb. 14, 1825, MS.) Marshall here refers to the letter of George
Kremer, a Representative in Congress from Pennsylvania. Kremer
wrote an anonymous letter to the <i>Columbian Observer</i> in which he
asserted that Clay had agreed to deliver votes to Adams as the price
of Clay's appointment to the office of Secretary of State. After much
bluster, Kremer admitted that he had no evidence whatever to support
his charge; yet his accusation permanently besmirched Clay's
reputation. (For an account of the Kremer incident see Sargent, <span class="smcap">i</span>,
67-74, 123-24.)
</p><p>
Out of the Kremer letter grew a distrust of Clay which he never
really lived down. Some time later, John Randolph seized an opportunity
to call the relation between President Adams and his Secretary
of State "the coalition of Blifil and Black George&mdash;the combination,
unheard of till then, of the Puritan with the blackleg." The bloodless,
but not the less real duel, that followed, ended this quarrel, though
the unjust charges never quite died out. (Schurz: <i>Henry Clay</i>, <span class="smcap">i</span>, 273-74.)</p></div>

In a letter even less emotional than Marshall's, Madison favored
the same plan. (<i>Ib.</i> pp. v, vi.) Lafayette, with his unfailing floridity,
says that he is "proud ... of the honor of being one of the Vice Presidents
of the Society," and that "the progressing state of our Liberia
establishment is ... a source of enjoyment, and the most lively interest"
to him. (<i>Ib.</i> p. v.)

At the time of his death, Marshall was President of the Virginia
branch of the Society, and his ancient enemy, John Tyler, who succeeded
him in that office, paid a remarkable tribute to the goodness and
greatness of the man he had so long opposed. (Tyler: <i>Tyler</i>, <span class="smcap">i</span>, 567-68.)</p></div>

earnestly opposed Marshall in the Judiciary debate, said that no man
felt "more respect" than he for Marshall's opinions which are justly
esteemed "not only in this Convention, but throughout the United
States." (<i>Debates, Va. Conv.</i> 505.) Randolph spoke of "the very great
weight" which Marshall had in the convention, in Virginia, and
throughout the Nation. (<i>Ib.</i> 500.) Thomas M. Bayly of Accomack
County, while utterly disagreeing with the Chief Justice on the
County Court system, declared that Marshall, "as a lawyer and
Judge, is without a rival." (<i>Ib.</i> 510.) Richard H. Henderson of Loudoun
County called the Chief Justice his "political father" whose
lessons he delighted to follow, and upon whose "wisdom, ... virtue, ... prudence"
he implicitly relied. (Henderson's statement as repeated by
Benjamin W. Leigh, <i>ib.</i> 544.) Charles F. Mercer of the same county
"expressed toward Judge Marshall a filial respect and veneration
not surpassed by the ties which had bound him to a natural parent."
(<i>Ib.</i> 563.) Such are examples of the expressions toward Marshall
throughout the prolonged sessions of the convention.</p></div>

This was the last formal attempt, but one, made in Congress during
Marshall's lifetime, to impair the efficiency of National courts.
The final attack was made by Joseph Lecompte, a Representative
from Kentucky, who on January 27, 1832, offered a resolution instructing
the Judiciary Committee to "inquire into the expediency
of amending the constitution ... so that the judges of the Supreme
Court, and of the inferior courts, shall hold their offices for a limited
term of years." On February 24, the House, by a vote of 141 to 27,
refused to consider Lecompte's resolution, ignoring his plea to be allowed
to explain it. (<i>Debates</i>, 22d Cong. 1st Sess. 1856-57.) So summary
and brusque&mdash;almost contemptuous&mdash;was the rejection of
Lecompte's proposal, as almost to suggest that personal feeling was
an element in the action taken by the House.</p></div>

<h3>THE FINAL CONFLICT</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable. (Daniel Webster.)</p>

<p>Fellow citizens, the die is now cast. Prepare for the crisis and meet it as becomes
men and freemen. (South Carolina Ordinance of Nullification.)</p>

<p>The Union has been prolonged thus far by miracles. I fear they cannot continue.
(Marshall.)</p>

<p class="poem">
It is time to be old,<br />
To take in sail.   (Emerson.)<br />
</p></div>


<p>The last years of Marshall's life were clouded with
sadness, almost despair. His health failed; his wife
died; the Supreme Court was successfully defied; his
greatest opinion was repudiated and denounced by a
strong and popular President; his associates on the
Bench were departing from some of his most cherished
views; and the trend of public events convinced him
that his labor to construct an enduring nation, to create
institutions of orderly freedom, to introduce stability
and system into democracy, had been in vain.</p>

<p>Yet, even in this unhappy period, there were hours
of triumph for John Marshall. He heard his doctrine
of Nationalism championed by Daniel Webster, who,
in one of the greatest debates of history, used Marshall's
arguments and almost his very words; he beheld
the militant assertion of the same principle by
Andrew Jackson, who, in this instance, also employed
Marshall's reasoning and method of statement; and
he witnessed the sudden flowering of public appreciation
of his character and services.</p>

<p>During the spring of 1831, Marshall found himself,
for the first time in his life, suffering from acute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
pain. His Richmond physician could give him no
relief; and he became so despondent that he determined
to resign immediately after the ensuing Presidential
election, in case Jackson should be defeated,
an event which many then thought probable. In a
letter about the house at which the members of the
Supreme Court were to board during the next term,
Marshall tells Story of his purpose: "Being ... a bird
of passage, whose continuance with you cannot be
long, I did not chuse to permit my convenience or my
wishes to weigh a feather in the permanent arrangements....
But in addition, I felt serious doubts, although
I did not mention them, whether I should
be with you at the next term.</p>

<p>"What I am about to say is, of course, in perfect
confidence which I would not breathe to any other
person whatever. I had unaccountably calculated
on the election of P[residen]t taking place next fall,
and had determined to make my continuance in
office another year dependent on that event.</p>

<p>"You know how much importance I attach to
the character of the person who is to succeed me,
and calculate the influence which probabilities on
that subject would have on my continuance in
office. This, however, is a matter of great delicacy
on which I cannot and do not speak.</p>

<p>"My erroneous calculation of the time of the election
was corrected as soon as the pressure of official
duty was removed from my mind, and I had nearly
decided on my course, but recent events produce
such real uncertainty respecting the future as to
create doubts whether I ought not to await the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
same chances in the fall of 32 which I had intended
to await in the fall of 31."<a name="FNanchor_1390_1390" id="FNanchor_1390_1390"></a><a href="#Footnote_1390_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a></p>

<p>Marshall steadily became worse, and in September
he went to Philadelphia to consult the celebrated
physician and surgeon, Dr. Philip Syng Physick,
who at once perceived that the Chief Justice was suffering
from stone in the bladder. His affliction could
be relieved only by the painful and delicate operation
of lithotomy, which Dr. Physick had introduced in
America. From his sick-room Marshall writes Story
of his condition during the previous five months, and
adds that he looks "with impatience for the operation."<a name="FNanchor_1391_1391" id="FNanchor_1391_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a>
He is still concerned about the court's
boarding-place and again refers to his intention of
leaving the Bench: "In the course of the summer ...
I found myself unequal to the effective consideration
of any subject, and had determined to resign at the
close of the year. This determination, however, I
kept to myself, being determined to remain master
of my own conduct." Story had answered Marshall's
letter of June 26, evidently protesting against the
thought of the Chief Justice giving up his office.</p>

<p>Marshall replies: "On the most interesting part of
your letter I have felt, and still feel, great difficulty.
You understand my general sentiments on that
subject as well as I do myself. I am most earnestly
attached to the character of the department, and
to the wishes and convenience of those with whom
it has been my pride and my happiness to be associated
for so many years. I cannot be insensible to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
the gloom which lours over us. I have a repugnance
to abandoning you under such circumstances
which is almost invincible. But the solemn convictions
of my judgement sustained by some pride of
character admonish me not to hazard the disgrace
of continuing in office a mere inefficient pageant."<a name="FNanchor_1392_1392" id="FNanchor_1392_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a></p>

<p>Had Adams been re&euml;lected in 1828, there can be
no doubt that Marshall would have resigned during
that Administration; and it is equally certain that,
if Jackson had been defeated in 1832, the Chief Justice
would have retired immediately. The Democratic
success in the election of that year determined
him to hold on in an effort to keep the Supreme
Court, as long as possible, unsubmerged by the rising
tide of radical Localism. Perhaps he also clung to a
desperate hope that, during his lifetime, a political
reaction would occur and a conservative President
be chosen who could appoint his successor.</p>

<p>When Marshall arrived at Philadelphia, the bar of
that city wished to give him a dinner, and, by way
of invitation, adopted remarkable resolutions expressing
their grateful praise and affectionate admiration.
The afflicted Chief Justice, deeply touched,
declined in a letter of singular grace and dignity: "It
is impossible for me ... to do justice to the feelings
with which I receive your very flattering address; ...
to have performed the official duties assigned to me
by my country in such a manner as to acquire the approbation
of" the Philadelphia bar, "affords me the
highest gratification of which I am capable, and is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
more than an ample reward for the labor which those
duties impose." Marshall's greatest satisfaction, he
says, is that he and his associates on the Supreme
Bench "have never sought to enlarge the judicial
power beyond its proper bounds, nor feared to carry
it to the fullest extent that duty required."<a name="FNanchor_1393_1393" id="FNanchor_1393_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a> The
members of the bar then begged the Chief Justice
to receive them "in a body" at "the United States
Courtroom"; and also to "permit his portrait to be
taken" by "an eminent artist of this city."<a name="FNanchor_1394_1394" id="FNanchor_1394_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a></p>

<p>With anxiety, but calmness and even good humor,
Marshall awaited the operation. Just before he went
to the surgeon's table, Dr. Jacob Randolph, who
assisted Dr. Physick, found Marshall eating a hearty
breakfast. Notwithstanding the pain he suffered,
the Chief Justice laughingly explained that, since it
might be the last meal he ever would enjoy, he had
determined to make the most of it. He understood
that the chances of surviving the operation were
against him, but he was eager to take them, since he
would rather die than continue to suffer the agony
he had been enduring.</p>

<p>While the long and excruciating operation went
on, by which more than a thousand calculi were
removed, Marshall was placid, "scarcely uttering
a murmur throughout the whole procedure." The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
physicians ascribed his recovery "in a great degree
... to his extraordinary self possession, and to the calm
and philosophical views which he took of his case."<a name="FNanchor_1395_1395" id="FNanchor_1395_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1395_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a></p>

<p>Marshall writes Story about his experience and
the results of the treatment, saying that he must
take medicine "continually to prevent new formations,"
and adding, with humorous melancholy, that
he "must submit too to a severe and most unsociable
regimen." He cautions Story to care for his
own health, which Judge Peters had told him was
bad. "Without your vigorous and powerful co-operation
I should be in despair, and think the 'ship must
be given up.'"<a name="FNanchor_1396_1396" id="FNanchor_1396_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a></p>

<p>On learning of his improved condition, Story writes
Peters from Cambridge: "This seems to me a special
interposition of Providence in favor of the Constitution....
He is beloved and reverenced here beyond
all measure, though not beyond his merits. Next to
Washington he stands the idol of all good men."<a name="FNanchor_1397_1397" id="FNanchor_1397_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a></p>

<p>While on this distressing visit to Philadelphia,
Marshall writes his wife two letters&mdash;the last letters
to her of which any originals or copies can be found.
"I anticipate with a pleasure which I know you will
share the time when I may sit by your side by our
tranquil fire side &amp; enjoy the happiness of your
society without inflicting on you the pain of witnessing
my suffering.... I am treated with the most flattering
attentions in Philadelphia. They give me pain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
the more pain as the necessity of declining many of
them may be ascribed to a want of sensibility."<a name="FNanchor_1398_1398" id="FNanchor_1398_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a></p>

<p>His recovery assured, Marshall again writes his
wife: "I have at length risen from my bed and
am able to hold a pen. The most delightful use
I can make of it is to tell you that I am getting
well ... from the painful disease with which I have
been so long affected.... Nothing delights me so
much as to hear from my friends and especially
from you. How much was I gratified at the line
from your own hand in Mary's letter.<a name="FNanchor_1399_1399" id="FNanchor_1399_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a>... I am
much obliged by your offer to lend me money.<a name="FNanchor_1400_1400" id="FNanchor_1400_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a>
I hope I shall not need it but can not as yet speak
positively as my stay has been longer and my expenses
greater than I had anticipated on leaving
home. Should I use any part of it, you may be assured
it will be replaced on my return. But this is
a subject on which I know you feel no solicitude....
God bless you my dearest Polly love to all our
friends. Ever your most affectionate J. Marshall."<a name="FNanchor_1401_1401" id="FNanchor_1401_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1401_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a></p>

<p>On December 25, 1831, his "dearest Polly" died.
The previous day, she hung about his neck a locket
containing a wisp of her hair. For the remainder of
his life he wore this memento, never parting with it
night or day.<a name="FNanchor_1402_1402" id="FNanchor_1402_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a> Her weakness, physical and mental,
which prevailed throughout practically the whole of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
their married life, inspired in Marshall a chivalric
adoration. On the morning of the first anniversary
of her death, Story chanced to go into Marshall's
room and "found him in tears. He had just finished
writing out for me some lines of General Burgoyne,
of which he spoke to me last evening as eminently
beautiful and affecting.... I saw at once that he
had been shedding tears over the memory of his own
wife, and he has said to me several times during the
term, that the moment he relaxes from business he
feels exceedingly depressed, and rarely goes through
a night without weeping over his departed wife.... I
think he is the most extraordinary man I ever saw,
for the depth and tenderness of his feelings."<a name="FNanchor_1403_1403" id="FNanchor_1403_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_1403_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span></p>

<p>But Marshall had also written something which
he did not show even to Story&mdash;a tribute to his wife:</p>

<p>"This day of joy and festivity to the whole Christian
world is, to my sad heart, the anniversary of
the keenest affliction which humanity can sustain.
While all around is gladness, my mind dwells on
the silent tomb, and cherishes the remembrance
of the beloved object which it contains.</p>

<p>"On the 25th of December, 1831, it was the will
of Heaven to take to itself the companion who had
sweetened the choicest part of my life, had rendered
toil a pleasure, had partaken of all my feelings, and
was enthroned in the inmost recess of my heart.
Never can I cease to feel the loss and to deplore it.
Grief for her is too sacred ever to be profaned on
this day, which shall be, during my existence, marked
by a recollection of her virtues.</p>

<p>"On the 3d of January, 1783, I was united by the
holiest bonds to the woman I adored. From the moment
of our union to that of our separation, I never
ceased to thank Heaven for this its best gift. Not a
moment passed in which I did not consider her as a
blessing from which the chief happiness of my life was
derived. This never-dying sentiment, originating in
love, was cherished by a long and close observation
of as amiable and estimable qualities as ever adorned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
the female bosom. To a person which in youth was
very attractive, to manners uncommonly pleasing,
she added a fine understanding, and the sweetest
temper which can accompany a just and modest
sense of what was due to herself.</p>

<p>"She was educated with a profound reverence for
religion, which she preserved to her last moments.
This sentiment, among her earliest and deepest impressions,
gave a colouring to her whole life. Hers
was the religion taught by the Saviour of man. She
was a firm believer in the faith inculcated by the
Church (Episcopal) in which she was bred.</p>

<p>"I have lost her, and with her have lost the solace
of my life! Yet she remains still the companion of my
retired hours, still occupies my inmost bosom. When
alone and unemployed, my mind still recurs to her.
More than a thousand times since the 25th of December,
1831, have I repeated to myself the beautiful
lines written by General Burgoyne, under a similar
affliction, substituting 'Mary' for 'Anna':</p>

<p class="poem">
"'Encompass'd in an angel's frame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An angel's virtues lay:</span><br />
Too soon did Heaven assert its claim<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And take its own away!</span><br />
My Mary's worth, my Mary's charms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can never more return!</span><br />
What now shall fill these widow'd arms?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, me! my Mary's urn!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, me! ah, me! my Mary's urn!'"<a name="FNanchor_1404_1404" id="FNanchor_1404_1404"></a><a href="#Footnote_1404_1404" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>After his wife's death, Marshall arranged to live
at "Leeds Manor," Fauquier County, a large house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
on part of the Fairfax estate which he had given to
his son, James Keith Marshall. A room, with very
thick walls to keep out the noise of his son's many
children, was built for him, adjoining the main
dwelling. Here he brought his library, papers, and
many personal belongings. His other sons and their
families lived not far away; "Leeds Manor" was
in the heart of the country where he had grown to
early manhood; and there he expected to spend his
few remaining years.<a name="FNanchor_1405_1405" id="FNanchor_1405_1405"></a><a href="#Footnote_1405_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a> He could not, however, tear
himself from his Richmond home, where he continued
to live most of the time until his death.<a name="FNanchor_1406_1406" id="FNanchor_1406_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1406_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a></p>

<p>When fully recovered from his operation, Marshall
seemed to acquire fresh strength. He "is in
excellent health, never better, and as firm and robust
in mind as in body," Story informs Charles
Sumner.<a name="FNanchor_1407_1407" id="FNanchor_1407_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1407_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a></p>

<p>The Chief Justice was, however, profoundly depressed.
The course that President Jackson was
then pursuing&mdash;his attitude toward the Supreme
Court in the Georgia controversy,<a name="FNanchor_1408_1408" id="FNanchor_1408_1408"></a><a href="#Footnote_1408_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a> his arbitrary and
violent rule, his hostility to the second Bank of the
United States&mdash;alarmed and distressed Marshall.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">

</div>

<p>The Bank had finally justified the brightest predictions
of its friends. Everywhere in the country
its notes were as good as gold, while abroad they
were often above par.<a name="FNanchor_1409_1409" id="FNanchor_1409_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1409_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a> Its stock was owned in every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
nation and widely distributed in America.<a name="FNanchor_1410_1410" id="FNanchor_1410_1410"></a><a href="#Footnote_1410_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a> Up to
the time when Jackson began his warfare upon the
Bank, the financial management of Nicholas Biddle
had been as brilliant as it was sound.<a name="FNanchor_1411_1411" id="FNanchor_1411_1411"></a><a href="#Footnote_1411_1411" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a></p>

<p>But popular hostility to the Bank had never ceased.
In addition to the old animosity toward any central
institution of finance, charges were made that directors
of certain branches of the Bank had used their
power to interfere in politics. As implacable as they
were unjust were the assaults made by Democratic
politicians upon Jeremiah Mason, director of the
branch at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Had the
Bank consented to Mason's removal, it is possible
that Jackson's warfare on it would not have been
prosecuted.<a name="FNanchor_1412_1412" id="FNanchor_1412_1412"></a><a href="#Footnote_1412_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a></p>

<p>The Bank's charter was to expire in 1836. In his
first annual Message to Congress the President
briefly called attention to the question of rechartering
the institution. The constitutionality of the Bank
Act was doubtful at best, he intimated, and the Bank
certainly had not established a sound and uniform
currency.<a name="FNanchor_1413_1413" id="FNanchor_1413_1413"></a><a href="#Footnote_1413_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a> In his next Message, a year later, Jackson
repeated more strongly his attack upon the Bank.<a name="FNanchor_1414_1414" id="FNanchor_1414_1414"></a><a href="#Footnote_1414_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a></p>

<p>Two years afterwards, on the eve of the Presidential
campaign of 1832, the friends of the Bank in
Congress passed, by heavy majorities, a bill extend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>ing
the charter for fifteen years after March 3, 1836,
the date of its expiration.<a name="FNanchor_1415_1415" id="FNanchor_1415_1415"></a><a href="#Footnote_1415_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a> The principal supporters
of this measure were Clay and Webster and, indeed,
most of the weighty men in the National Legislature.
But they were enemies of Jackson, and he looked
upon the rechartering of the Bank as a personal
affront.</p>

<p>On July 4, 1832, the bill was sent to the President.
Six days later he returned it with his veto. Jackson's
veto message was as able as it was cunning. Parts
of it were demagogic appeals to popular passion;
but the heart of it was an attack upon Marshall's
opinions in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland and Osborn <i>vs.</i>
The Bank.</p>

<p>The Bank is a monopoly, its stockholders and
directors a "privileged order"; worse still, the institution
is rapidly passing into the hands of aliens&mdash;"already
is almost a third of the stock in foreign
hands." If we must have a bank, let it be "<i>purely
American</i>." This aristocratic, monopolistic, un-American
concern exists by the authority of an
unconstitutional act of Congress. Even worse is the
rechartering act which he now vetoed.</p>

<p>The decision of the Supreme Court in the Bank
cases, settled nothing, said Jackson. Marshall's
opinions were, for the most part, erroneous and
"ought not to control the co-ordinate authorities of
this Government. The Congress, the Executive, and
the Court must each for itself be guided by its own
opinion of the Constitution.... It is as much the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
duty of the House of Representatives, of the Senate,
and of the President to decide upon the constitutionality
of any bill or resolution which may
be presented to them for passage or approval as it
is of the supreme judges when it may be brought
before them for judicial decision.</p>

<p>"The opinion of the judges has no more authority
over Congress than the opinion of Congress has over
the judges, and on that point the President is independent
of both. The authority of the Supreme
Court must not, therefore, be permitted to control
the Congress or the Executive when acting in their
legislative capacities, but to have only such influence
as the force of their reasoning may deserve."<a name="FNanchor_1416_1416" id="FNanchor_1416_1416"></a><a href="#Footnote_1416_1416" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a></p>

<p>But, says Jackson, the court did not decide that
"all features of this corporation are compatible with
the Constitution." He quotes&mdash;and puts in italics&mdash;Marshall's
statement that "<i>where the law is not
prohibited and is really calculated to effect any of the
objects intrusted to the Government, to undertake here
to inquire into the degree of its necessity would be to
pass the line which circumscribes the judicial department
and to tread on legislative ground</i>." This language,
insists Jackson, means that "it is the exclusive
province of Congress and the President to decide
whether the particular features of this act are <i>necessary</i>
and <i>proper</i> ... and therefore constitutional, or
<i>unnecessary</i> and <i>improper</i>, and therefore unconstitutional."<a name="FNanchor_1417_1417" id="FNanchor_1417_1417"></a><a href="#Footnote_1417_1417" class="fnanchor">[1417]</a>
Thereupon Jackson points out what he
considers to be the defects of the bill.</p>

<p>Congress has no power to "grant exclusive privi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>leges
or monopolies," except in the District of Columbia
and in the matter of patents and copyrights.
"Every act of Congress, therefore, which attempts,
by grants of monopolies or sale of exclusive privileges
for a limited time, or a time without limit, to restrict
or extinguish its own discretion in the choice of means
to execute its delegated powers, is equivalent to a
legislative amendment of the Constitution, and palpably
unconstitutional."<a name="FNanchor_1418_1418" id="FNanchor_1418_1418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1418_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a> Jackson fiercely attacks
Marshall's opinion that the States cannot tax the
National Bank and its branches.</p>

<p>The whole message is able, adroit, and, on its face,
plainly intended as a campaign document.<a name="FNanchor_1419_1419" id="FNanchor_1419_1419"></a><a href="#Footnote_1419_1419" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a> A shrewd
appeal is made to the State banks. Popular jealousy
and suspicion of wealth and power are skillfully
played upon: "The rich and powerful" always use
governments for "their selfish purposes." When laws
are passed "to grant titles, gratuities, and exclusive
privileges, to make the rich richer and the potent
more powerful, the humble members of society&mdash;the
farmers, mechanics, and laborers&mdash;who have
neither the time nor the means of securing like favors
to themselves, have a right to complain of the injustice
of their Government.</p>

<p>"There are no necessary evils in government,"
says Jackson. "Its evils exist only in its abuses. If
it would confine itself to equal protection, and, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
Heaven does its rains, shower its favors alike on the
high and the low, the rich and the poor, it would be
an unqualified blessing"&mdash;thus he runs on to his
conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_1420_1420" id="FNanchor_1420_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1420_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a></p>

<p>The masses of the people, particularly those of the
South, responded with wild fervor to the President's
assault upon the citadel of the "money power." John
Marshall, the defender of special privilege, had said
that the Bank law was protected by the Constitution;
but Andrew Jackson, the champion of the common
people, declared that it was prohibited by the Constitution.
Hats in the air, then, and loud cheers
for the hero who had dared to attack and to overcome
this financial monster as he had fought and
beaten the invading British!</p>

<p>Marshall was infinitely disgusted. He informs
Story of Virginia's applause of Jackson's veto: "We
are up to the chin in politics. Virginia was always
insane enough to be opposed to the Bank of The
United States, and therefore hurras for the veto.
But we are a little doubtful how it may work in
Pennsylvania. It is not difficult to account for the
part New York may take. She has sagacity enough
to see her interest in putting down the present bank.
Her mercantile position gives her a controul, a commanding
controul, over the currency and the exchanges
of the country, if there be no Bank of The
United States. Going for herself she may approve
this policy; but Virginia ought not to drudge for her
benefit."<a name="FNanchor_1421_1421" id="FNanchor_1421_1421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1421_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span></p>

<p>Jackson did not sign the bill for the improvement
of rivers and harbors, passed at the previous session
of Congress, because, as he said, he had not "sufficient
time ... to examine it before the adjournment."<a name="FNanchor_1422_1422" id="FNanchor_1422_1422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1422_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a>
Everybody took the withholding of his
signature as a veto.<a name="FNanchor_1423_1423" id="FNanchor_1423_1423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1423_1423" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a> This bill included a feasible
project for making the Virginia Capital accessible to
seagoing vessels. Even this action of the President
was applauded by Virginians:</p>

<p>"We show our wisdom most strikingly in approving
the veto on the harbor bill also," Marshall writes
Story. "That bill contained an appropriation intended
to make Richmond a seaport, which she is
not at present, for large vessels fit to cross the
Atlantic. The appropriation was whittled down in
the House of Representatives to almost nothing....
Yet we wished the appropriation because we were
confident that Congress when correctly informed,
would add the necessary sum. This too is vetoed;
and for this too our sagacious politicians are thankful.
We seem to think it the summit of human wisdom,
or rather of American patriotism, to preserve
our poverty."<a name="FNanchor_1424_1424" id="FNanchor_1424_1424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1424_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a></p>

<p>During the Presidential campaign of 1832, Marshall
all but despaired of the future of the Republic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
The autocracy of Jackson's reign; the popular enthusiasm
which greeted his wildest departures from
established usage and orderly government; the state
of the public mind, indicated everywhere by the encouragement
of those whom Marshall believed to be
theatrical and adventurous demagogues&mdash;all these
circumstances perturbed and saddened him.</p>

<p>And for the time being, his fears were wholly justified.
Triumphantly re&euml;lected, Jackson pursued
the Bank relentlessly. Finally he ordered that the
Government funds should no longer be deposited in
that hated institution. Although that desperate act
brought disaster on business throughout the land,
it was acclaimed by the multitude. In alarm and
despair, Marshall writes Story: "We [Virginians] are
insane on the subject of the Bank. Its friends, who
are not numerous, dare not, a few excepted, to avow
themselves."<a name="FNanchor_1425_1425" id="FNanchor_1425_1425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1425_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a></p>

<p>But the sudden increase and aggressiveness of
disunion sentiment oppressed Marshall more heavily
than any other public circumstance of his last years.
The immediate occasion for the recrudescence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
Localism was the Tariff. Since the Tariff of 1816 the
South had been discontented with the protection
afforded the manufacturers of the North and East;
and had made loud outcry against the protective
Tariff of 1824. The Southern people felt that their
interests were sacrificed for the benefit of the manufacturing
sections; they believed that all that they
produced had to be sold in a cheap, unprotected
market, and all that they purchased had to be bought
in a dear, protected market; they were convinced that
the protective tariff system, and, indeed, the whole
Nationalist policy, meant the ruin of the South.</p>

<p>Moreover, they began to see that the power that
could enact a protective tariff, control commerce,
make internal improvements, could also control
slavery&mdash;perhaps abolish it.<a name="FNanchor_1426_1426" id="FNanchor_1426_1426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1426_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a> Certainly that was
"the spirit" of Marshall's construction of the Constitution,
they said. "Sir," exclaimed Robert S.
Garnett of Virginia during the debate in the House
on the Tariff of 1824, "we must look very little to
consequences if we do not perceive in the spirit of
this construction, combined with the political fanaticism
of the period, reason to anticipate, at no distant
day, the usurpation, on the part of Congress, of
the right to legislate upon a subject which, if you
once touch, will inevitably throw this country into
revolution&mdash;I mean that of slavery.... Can whole
nations be mistaken? When I speak of nations, I
mean Virginia, the Carolinas, and other great Southern
commonwealths."<a name="FNanchor_1427_1427" id="FNanchor_1427_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1427_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a></p>

<p>John Carter of South Carolina warned the House<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
not to pass a law "which would, as to this portion of
the Union, be registered on our statute books as a
dead letter."<a name="FNanchor_1428_1428" id="FNanchor_1428_1428"></a><a href="#Footnote_1428_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a> James Hamilton, Jr., of the same
State, afterwards a Nullification Governor, asked:
"Is it nothing to weaken the attachment of one section
of this confederacy to the bond of Union?... Is
it nothing to sow the seeds of incurable alienation?"<a name="FNanchor_1429_1429" id="FNanchor_1429_1429"></a><a href="#Footnote_1429_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a></p>

<p>The Tariff of 1828 alarmed and angered the Southern
people to the point of frenzy. "The interests of
the South have been ... shamefully sacrificed!" cried
Hayne in the Senate. "Her feelings have been disregarded;
her wishes slighted; her honest pride insulted!"<a name="FNanchor_1430_1430" id="FNanchor_1430_1430"></a><a href="#Footnote_1430_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a>
So enraged were Southern Representatives
that, for the most part, they declined to speak.
Hamilton expressed their sentiments. He disdained
to enter into the "chaffering" about the details of
the bill.<a name="FNanchor_1431_1431" id="FNanchor_1431_1431"></a><a href="#Footnote_1431_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a> "You are coercing us to inquire, whether
we can afford to belong to a confederacy in which
severe restrictions, tending to an ultimate prohibition
of foreign commerce, is its established policy.<a name="FNanchor_1432_1432" id="FNanchor_1432_1432"></a><a href="#Footnote_1432_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a>...
Is it ... treason, sir, to tell you that there is a condition
of public feeling throughout the southern part
of this confederacy, which no prudent man will treat
with contempt, and no man who loves his country
will not desire to see allayed?<a name="FNanchor_1433_1433" id="FNanchor_1433_1433"></a><a href="#Footnote_1433_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a>... I trust, sir, that
this cup may pass from us.... But, if an adverse
destiny should be ours&mdash;if we are doomed to drink
'the waters of bitterness,' in their utmost woe, ...
South Carolina will be found on the side of those
principles, standing firmly, on the very ground which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
is canonized by that revolution which has made us
what we are, and imbued us with the spirit of a free
and sovereign people."<a name="FNanchor_1434_1434" id="FNanchor_1434_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a></p>

<p>Retaliation, even forcible resistance, was talked
throughout the South when this "Tariff of Abominations,"
as the Act of 1828 was called, became a law.
The feeling in South Carolina especially ran high.
Some of her ablest men proposed that the State
should tax all articles<a name="FNanchor_1435_1435" id="FNanchor_1435_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1435_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a> protected by the tariff.
Pledges were made at public meetings not to buy
protected goods manufactured in the North. At the
largest gathering in the history of the State, resolutions
were passed demanding that all trade with
tariff States be stopped.<a name="FNanchor_1436_1436" id="FNanchor_1436_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a> Nullification was proposed.<a name="FNanchor_1437_1437" id="FNanchor_1437_1437"></a><a href="#Footnote_1437_1437" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a>
The people wildly acclaimed such a method
of righting their wrongs, and Calhoun gave to the
world his famous "Exposition," a treatise based on
the Jeffersonian doctrine of thirty years previous.<a name="FNanchor_1438_1438" id="FNanchor_1438_1438"></a><a href="#Footnote_1438_1438" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a></p>

<p>A little more than a year after the passage of the
Tariff of 1824, and the publication of Marshall's
opinions in Osborn <i>vs.</i> The Bank and Gibbons <i>vs.</i>
Ogden, Jefferson had written Giles of the "encroachments"
by the National Government, particularly
by the Supreme Court and by Congress. How should
these invasions of the rights of the States be checked?
"Reason and argument? You might as well reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
and argue with the marble columns encircling them
[Congress and the Supreme Court].... Are we then
<i>to stand to our arms</i>?... No. That must be the last
resource." But the States should denounce the
acts of usurpation "until their accumulation shall
overweigh that of separation."<a name="FNanchor_1439_1439" id="FNanchor_1439_1439"></a><a href="#Footnote_1439_1439" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a> Jefferson's letter,
written only six months before his death, was made
public just as the tide of belligerent Nullification
was beginning to rise throughout the South.<a name="FNanchor_1440_1440" id="FNanchor_1440_1440"></a><a href="#Footnote_1440_1440" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a></p>

<p>At the same time defiance of National authority
came also from Georgia, the cause being as distinct
from the tariff as the principle of resistance was
identical. This cause was the forcible seizure, by
Georgia, of the lands of the Cherokee Indians and
the action of the Supreme Court in cases growing
out of Georgia's policy and the execution of it.</p>

<p>By numerous treaties between the National Government
and the Cherokee Nation, the Indians were
guaranteed protection in the enjoyment of their
lands. When Georgia, in 1802, ceded her claim to
that vast territory stretching westward to the Mississippi,
it had been carefully provided that the lands
of the Indians should be preserved from seizure or
entry without their consent, and that their rights
should be defended from invasion or disturbance.
The Indian titles were to be extinguished, however,
as soon as this could be done peaceably, and without
inordinate expense.</p>

<p>In 1827, these Georgia Cherokees, who were
highly civilized, adopted a constitution, set up a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
government of their own modeled upon that of the
United States, and declared themselves a sovereign
independent nation.<a name="FNanchor_1441_1441" id="FNanchor_1441_1441"></a><a href="#Footnote_1441_1441" class="fnanchor">[1441]</a> Immediately thereafter the
Legislature of Georgia passed resolutions declaring
that the Cherokee lands belonged to the State "absolutely"&mdash;that
the Indians were only "tenants
at her will"; that Georgia had the right to, and
would, extend her laws throughout her "conventional
limits," and "coerce obedience to them from all
descriptions of people, be they white, red, or black."<a name="FNanchor_1442_1442" id="FNanchor_1442_1442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1442_1442" class="fnanchor">[1442]</a></p>

<p>Deliberately, but without delay, the State enacted
laws taking over the Cherokee lands, dividing them
into counties, and annulling "all laws, usages and customs"
of the Indians.<a name="FNanchor_1443_1443" id="FNanchor_1443_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1443_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a> The Cherokees appealed to
President Jackson, who rebuffed them and upheld
Georgia.<a name="FNanchor_1444_1444" id="FNanchor_1444_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1444_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a> Gold was discovered in the Indian country,
and white adventurers swarmed to the mines.<a name="FNanchor_1445_1445" id="FNanchor_1445_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1445_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a>
Georgia passed acts forbidding the Indians to hold
courts, or to make laws or regulations for the tribe.
White persons found in the Cherokee country without
a license from the Governor were, upon conviction,
to be imprisoned at hard labor for four years.
A State guard was established to "protect" the
mines and arrest any one "detected in a violation
of the laws of this State."<a name="FNanchor_1446_1446" id="FNanchor_1446_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1446_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a> Still other acts equally
oppressive were passed.<a name="FNanchor_1447_1447" id="FNanchor_1447_1447"></a><a href="#Footnote_1447_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span></p>

<p>On the advice of William Wirt, then Attorney-General
of the United States, and of John Sergeant of
Philadelphia, the Indians applied to the Supreme
Court for an injunction to stop Georgia from executing
these tyrannical statutes. The whole country was
swept by a tempest of popular excitement. South and
North took opposite sides. The doctrine of State
Rights, in whose name internal improvements, the
Tariff, the Bank, and other Nationalist measures had
been opposed, was invoked in behalf of Georgia.</p>

<p>The Administration tried to induce the Cherokees
to exchange their farms, mills, and stores in
Georgia for untamed lands in the Indian Territory.
The Indians sent a commission to investigate that
far-off region, which reported that it was unfit for
agriculture and that, once there, the Cherokees would
have to fight savage tribes.<a name="FNanchor_1448_1448" id="FNanchor_1448_1448"></a><a href="#Footnote_1448_1448" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a> Again they appealed to
the President; again Jackson told them that Georgia
had absolute authority over them. Angry debates
arose in Congress over a bill to send the reluctant
natives to the wilds of the then remote West.<a name="FNanchor_1449_1449" id="FNanchor_1449_1449"></a><a href="#Footnote_1449_1449" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a></p>

<p>Such was the origin of the case of The Cherokee
Nation <i>vs</i>. The State of Georgia.<a name="FNanchor_1450_1450" id="FNanchor_1450_1450"></a><a href="#Footnote_1450_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a> At Wirt's request,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
Judge Dabney Carr laid the whole matter before
Marshall, Wirt having determined to proceed with
it or to drop it as the Chief Justice should advise.
Marshall, of course, declined to express any opinion
on the legal questions involved: "I have followed the
debate in both houses of Congress, with profound
attention and with deep interest, and have wished,
most sincerely, that both the executive and legislative
departments had thought differently on the
subject. Humanity must bewail the course which is
pursued, whatever may be the decision of policy."<a name="FNanchor_1451_1451" id="FNanchor_1451_1451"></a><a href="#Footnote_1451_1451" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a></p>

<p>Before the case could be heard by the Supreme
Court, Georgia availed herself of an opportunity to
show her contempt for the National Judiciary and
to assert her "sovereign rights." A Cherokee named
George Tassels was convicted of murder in the Superior
Court of Hall County, Georgia, and lay in jail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
until the sentence of death should be executed. A
writ of error from the Supreme Court was obtained,
and Georgia was ordered to appear before that tribunal
and defend the judgment of the State Court.</p>

<p>The order was signed by Marshall. Georgia's reply
was as insulting and belligerent as it was prompt and
spirited. The Legislature resolved that "the interference
by the chief justice of the supreme court of
the U. States, in the administration of the criminal
laws of this state, ... is a flagrant violation of her
rights"; that the Governor "and every other officer
of this state" be directed to "disregard any and
every mandate and process ... purporting to proceed
from the chief justice or any associate justice of the
supreme court of the United States"; that the Governor
be "authorised and required, with all the force
and means ... at his command ... to resist and repel
any and every invasion from whatever quarter, upon
the administration of the criminal laws of this state";
that Georgia refuses to become a party to "the case
sought to be made before the supreme court"; and
that the Governor, "by express," direct the sheriff of
Hall County to execute the law in the case of George
Tassels.<a name="FNanchor_1452_1452" id="FNanchor_1452_1452"></a><a href="#Footnote_1452_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a></p>

<p>Five days later, Tassels was hanged,<a name="FNanchor_1453_1453" id="FNanchor_1453_1453"></a><a href="#Footnote_1453_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a> and the Supreme
Court of the United States, powerless to vindicate
its authority, defied and insulted by a "sovereign"
State, abandoned by the Administration, was
humiliated and helpless.</p>

<p>When he went home on the evening of January
4, 1831, John Quincy Adams, now a member of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
Congress, wrote in his diary that "the resolutions
of the legislature of Georgia setting at defiance the
Supreme Court of the United States are published
and approved in the Telegraph, the Administration
newspaper at this place.... The Constitution, the
laws and treaties of the United States are prostrate
in the State of Georgia. Is there any remedy for
this state of things? None. Because the Executive
of the United States is in League with the State of
Georgia.... This example ... will be imitated by
other States, and with regard to other national interests&mdash;perhaps
the tariff.... The Union is in the
most imminent danger of dissolution.... The ship is
about to founder."<a name="FNanchor_1454_1454" id="FNanchor_1454_1454"></a><a href="#Footnote_1454_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Cherokee Nation brought its suit
in the Supreme Court to enjoin the State from executing
its laws, and at the February term of 1831 it
was argued for the Indians by Wirt and Sergeant.
Georgia disdained to appear&mdash;not for a moment
would that proud State admit that the Supreme
Court of the Nation could exercise any authority
whatever over her.<a name="FNanchor_1455_1455" id="FNanchor_1455_1455"></a><a href="#Footnote_1455_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a></p>

<p>On March 18, 1831, Marshall delivered the opinion
of the majority of the court, and in it he laid down
the broad policy which the Government has unwaveringly
pursued ever since. At the outset the Chief
Justice plainly stated that his sympathies were with
the Indians,<a name="FNanchor_1456_1456" id="FNanchor_1456_1456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1456_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a> but that the court could not examine
the merits or go into the moralities of the contro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>versy,
because it had no jurisdiction. The Cherokees
sued as a foreign nation, but, while they did indeed
constitute a separate state, they were not a foreign
nation. The relation of the Indians to the United
States is "unlike that of any other two people in
existence." The territory comprises a "part of the
United States."<a name="FNanchor_1457_1457" id="FNanchor_1457_1457"></a><a href="#Footnote_1457_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a></p>

<p>In our foreign affairs and commercial regulations,
the Indians are subject to the control of the
National Government. "They acknowledge themselves
in their treaties to be under the protection of
the United States." They are not, then, foreign
nations, but rather "domestic dependent nations....
They are in a state of pupilage." Foreign governments
consider them so completely under our "sovereignty
and dominion" that it is universally conceded
that the acquisition of their lands or the making
of treaties with them would be "an invasion of
our territory, and an act of hostility." By the Constitution
power is given Congress to regulate commerce
among the States, with foreign nations, and
with Indian tribes, these terms being "entirely distinct."<a name="FNanchor_1458_1458" id="FNanchor_1458_1458"></a><a href="#Footnote_1458_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a></p>

<p>The Cherokees not being a foreign nation, the
Supreme Court has no jurisdiction in a suit brought
by them in that capacity, said Marshall. Furthermore,
the court was asked "to control the Legislature
of Georgia, and to restrain the exertion of its
physical force"&mdash;a very questionable "interposition,"
which "savors too much of the exercise of
political power to be within the proper province<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
of the judicial department." In "a proper case with
proper parties," the court might, perhaps, decide
"the mere question of right" to the Indian lands.
But the suit of the Cherokee Nation against Georgia
is not such a case.</p>

<p>Marshall closes with a reflection upon Jackson in
terms much like those with which, many years earlier,
he had so often rebuked Jefferson: "If it be true
that the Cherokee Nation have rights, this is not
the tribunal in which those rights are to be asserted.
If it be true that wrongs have been inflicted, and
that still greater are to be apprehended, this is not
the tribunal which can redress the past or prevent
the future."<a name="FNanchor_1459_1459" id="FNanchor_1459_1459"></a><a href="#Footnote_1459_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a></p>

<p>In this opinion the moral force of Marshall was
displayed almost as much as in the case of the
Schooner Exchange.<a name="FNanchor_1460_1460" id="FNanchor_1460_1460"></a><a href="#Footnote_1460_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a> He was friendly to the whole
Indian race; he particularly detested Georgia's treatment
of the Cherokees; he utterly rejected the State
Rights theory on which the State had acted; and he
could easily have decided in favor of the wronged
and harried Indians, as the dissent of Thompson and
Story proves. But the statesman and jurist again rose
above the man of sentiment, law above emotion, the
enduring above the transient.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span></p>

<p>As a "foreign state" the Indians had lost, but the
constitutionality of Georgia's Cherokee statutes had
not been affirmed. Wirt and Sergeant had erred as
to the method of attacking that legislation. Another
proceeding by Georgia, however, soon brought the
validity of her expansion laws before the Supreme
Court. Among the missionaries who for years had
labored in the Cherokee Nation was one Samuel
A. Worcester, a citizen of Vermont. This brave minister,
licensed by the National Government, employed
by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign
Missions, appointed by President John Quincy
Adams to be postmaster at New Echota, a Cherokee
town, refused, in company with several other missionaries,
to leave the Indian country.</p>

<p>Worcester and a Reverend Mr. Thompson were arrested
by the Georgia guard. The Superior Court of
Gwinnett County released them, however, on a writ
of habeas corpus, because, both being licensed missionaries
expending National funds appropriated for
civilizing Indians, they must be considered as agents
of the National Government. Moreover, Worcester
was postmaster at New Echota. Georgia demanded
his removal and inquired of Jackson whether the missionaries
were Government agents. The President
assured the State that they were not, and removed
Worcester from office.<a name="FNanchor_1461_1461" id="FNanchor_1461_1461"></a><a href="#Footnote_1461_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a></p>

<p>Thereupon both Worcester and Thompson were
promptly ordered to leave the State. But they
and some other missionaries remained, and were
arrested; dragged to prison&mdash;some of them with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
chains around their necks;<a name="FNanchor_1462_1462" id="FNanchor_1462_1462"></a><a href="#Footnote_1462_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a> tried and convicted.
Nine were pardoned upon their promise to depart
forthwith from Georgia. But Worcester and one
Elizur Butler sternly rejected the offer of clemency
on such a condition and were put to hard labor in
the penitentiary.</p>

<p>From the judgment of the Georgia court, Worcester
and Butler appealed to the Supreme Court of
the United States. Once more Marshall and Georgia
confronted each other; again the Chief Justice faced
a hostile President far more direct and forcible than
Jefferson, but totally lacking in the subtlety and skill
of that incomparable politician. Thrilling and highly
colored accounts of the treatment of the missionaries
had been published in every Northern newspaper;
religious journals made conspicuous display of soul-stirring
narratives of the whole subject; feeling in
the North ran high; resentment in the South rose
to an equal degree.</p>

<p>This time Georgia did more than ignore the Supreme
Court as in the case of George Tassels and in
the suit of the Cherokee Nation; she formally refused
to appear; formally denied the right of that
tribunal to pass upon the decisions of her courts.<a name="FNanchor_1463_1463" id="FNanchor_1463_1463"></a><a href="#Footnote_1463_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a>
Never would Georgia so "compromit her dignity as
a sovereign State," never so "yield her rights as a
member of the Confederacy." The new Governor,
Wilson Lumpkin, avowed that he would defend
those rights by every means in his power.<a name="FNanchor_1464_1464" id="FNanchor_1464_1464"></a><a href="#Footnote_1464_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a> When
the case of Worcester <i>vs.</i> Georgia came on for hearing
before the Supreme Court, no one answered for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
the State. Wirt, Sergeant, and Elisha W. Chester
appeared for the missionaries as they had for the
Indians.<a name="FNanchor_1465_1465" id="FNanchor_1465_1465"></a><a href="#Footnote_1465_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a> Wirt and Sergeant made extended and
powerful arguments.<a name="FNanchor_1466_1466" id="FNanchor_1466_1466"></a><a href="#Footnote_1466_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's opinion, delivered March 3, 1832, is
one of the noblest he ever wrote. "The legislative
power of a State, the controlling power of the Constitution
and laws of the United States, the rights,
if they have any, the political existence of a once
numerous and powerful people, the personal liberty
of a citizen, are all involved," begins the aged Chief
Justice.<a name="FNanchor_1467_1467" id="FNanchor_1467_1467"></a><a href="#Footnote_1467_1467" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a> Does the act of the Legislature of Georgia,
under which Worcester was convicted, violate the
Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United
States?<a name="FNanchor_1468_1468" id="FNanchor_1468_1468"></a><a href="#Footnote_1468_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a> That act is "an assertion of jurisdiction
over the Cherokee Nation."<a name="FNanchor_1469_1469" id="FNanchor_1469_1469"></a><a href="#Footnote_1469_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a></p>

<p>He then goes into a long historical review of the
relative titles of the natives and of the white discoverers
of America; of the effect upon these titles
of the numerous treaties with the Indians; of the
acts of Congress relating to the red men and their
lands; and of previous laws of Georgia on these
subjects.<a name="FNanchor_1470_1470" id="FNanchor_1470_1470"></a><a href="#Footnote_1470_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a> This part of his opinion is the most extended
and exhaustive historical analysis Marshall
ever made in any judicial utterance, except that on
the law of treason during the trial of Aaron Burr.<a name="FNanchor_1471_1471" id="FNanchor_1471_1471"></a><a href="#Footnote_1471_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a></p>

<p>Then comes his condensed, unanswerable, brilliant
conclusion: "A weaker power does not surrender
its independence, its rights to self-govern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>ment,
by associating with a stronger, and taking its
protection. A weak state, in order to provide for its
safety, may place itself under the protection of one
more powerful, without stripping itself of the right of
self-government, and ceasing to be a state.... The
Cherokee Nation ... is a distinct community, occupying
its own territory ... in which the laws of Georgia
can have no force, and which the citizens of Georgia
have no right to enter but with the assent of the
Cherokees themselves, or in conformity with treaties,
and with the acts of Congress. The whole intercourse
between the United States and this nation is by our
Constitution and laws vested in the government of
the United States."</p>

<p>The Cherokee Acts of the Georgia Legislature "are
repugnant to the constitution, laws and treaties of the
United States. They interfere forcibly with the relations
established between the United States and the
Cherokee Nation." This controlling fact the laws
of Georgia ignore. They violently disrupt the relations
between the Indians and the United States;
they are equally antagonistic to acts of Congress
based upon these treaties. Moreover, "the forcible
seizure and abduction" of Worcester, "who was residing
in the nation with its permission and by authority
of the President of the United States, is also
a violation of the acts which authorize the chief
magistrate to exercise this authority."</p>

<p>Marshall closes with a passage of eloquence almost
equal to, and of higher moral grandeur than, the
finest passages in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland and in
Cohens <i>vs.</i> Virginia. So the decision of the court<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
was that the judgment of the Georgia court be
"reversed and annulled."<a name="FNanchor_1472_1472" id="FNanchor_1472_1472"></a><a href="#Footnote_1472_1472" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a></p>

<p>Congress was intensely excited by Marshall's
opinion; Georgia was enraged; the President agitated
and belligerent. In a letter to Ticknor, written
five days after the judgment of the court was
announced, Story accurately portrays the situation:
"The decision produced a very strong sensation
in both houses; Georgia is full of anger and
violence.... Probably she will resist the execution
of our judgement, &amp; if she does I do not believe
the President will interfere.... The Court has done
its duty. Let the nation do theirs. If we have a
government let its commands be obeyed; if we
have not it is as well to know it at once, &amp; to look
to consequences."<a name="FNanchor_1473_1473" id="FNanchor_1473_1473"></a><a href="#Footnote_1473_1473" class="fnanchor">[1473]</a></p>

<p>Story's forecast was justified. Georgia scoffed at
Marshall's opinion, flouted the mandate of the Supreme
Court. "Usurpation!" cried Governor Lumpkin.
He would meet it "with the spirit of determined
resistance."<a name="FNanchor_1474_1474" id="FNanchor_1474_1474"></a><a href="#Footnote_1474_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a> Jackson defied the Chief Justice.
"John Marshall has made his decision:&mdash;<i>now let him
enforce it</i>!" the President is reported to have said.<a name="FNanchor_1475_1475" id="FNanchor_1475_1475"></a><a href="#Footnote_1475_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a>
Again the Supreme Court found itself powerless; the
judgment in Worcester <i>vs.</i> Georgia came to nothing;
the mandate was never obeyed, never heeded.<a name="FNanchor_1476_1476" id="FNanchor_1476_1476"></a><a href="#Footnote_1476_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span></p>

<p>For the time being, Marshall was defeated; Nationalism
was prostrate; Localism erect, strong,
aggressive. Soon, however, Marshall and Nationalism
were to be sustained, for the moment, by the
man most dreaded by the Chief Justice, most
trusted by Marshall's foes. Andrew Jackson was to
astound the country by the greatest and most illogical
act of his strange career&mdash;the issuance of
his immortal Proclamation against Nullification.</p>

<p>Georgia's very first assertion of her "sovereignty"
in the Indian controversy had strengthened South
Carolina's fast growing determination to resist the
execution of the Tariff Law. On January 25, 1830,
Senator Robert Young Hayne of South Carolina, in
his brilliant challenge to Webster, set forth the
philosophy of Nullification: "Sir, if, the measures
of the Federal Government were less oppressive,
we should still strive against this usurpation. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
South is acting on a principle she has always held
sacred&mdash;resistance to unauthorized taxation."<a name="FNanchor_1477_1477" id="FNanchor_1477_1477"></a><a href="#Footnote_1477_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a></p>

<p>Webster's immortal reply, so far as his Constitutional
argument is concerned, is little more than a
condensation of the Nationalist opinions of John
Marshall stated in popular and dramatic language.
Indeed, some of Webster's sentences are practically
mere repetitions of Marshall's, and his reasoning is
wholly that of the Chief Justice.</p>

<p>"We look upon the States, not as separated, but
as united under the same General Government, having
interests, common, associated, intermingled. In
war and peace, we are one; in commerce, one; because
the authority of the General Government
reaches to war and peace, and to the regulation of
commerce."<a name="FNanchor_1478_1478" id="FNanchor_1478_1478"></a><a href="#Footnote_1478_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a></p>

<p>What is the capital question in dispute? It is this:
"Whose prerogative is it to decide on the constitutionality
or unconstitutionality of the laws?"<a name="FNanchor_1479_1479" id="FNanchor_1479_1479"></a><a href="#Footnote_1479_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a> Can
States decide? Can States "annul the law of Congress"?
Hayne, expressing the view of South Carolina,
had declared that they could. He had based his
argument upon the Kentucky and Virginia Resolu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>tions&mdash;upon
the theory that the States, and not
the people, had created the Constitution; that the
States, and not the people, had established the General
Government.</p>

<p>But is this true? asked Webster. He answered
by paraphrasing Marshall's words in M'Culloch <i>vs.</i>
Maryland: "It is, sir, the people's constitution, the
people's Government; made for the people; made
by the people; and answerable to the people.<a name="FNanchor_1480_1480" id="FNanchor_1480_1480"></a><a href="#Footnote_1480_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a> The
people ... have declared that this Constitution shall
be the supreme law....<a name="FNanchor_1481_1481" id="FNanchor_1481_1481"></a><a href="#Footnote_1481_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a> Who is to judge between the
people and the Government?"<a name="FNanchor_1482_1482" id="FNanchor_1482_1482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1482_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a></p>

<p>The Constitution settles that question by declaring
that "the judicial power shall extend to all cases arising
under the Constitution and laws."<a name="FNanchor_1483_1483" id="FNanchor_1483_1483"></a><a href="#Footnote_1483_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a> Because of
this the Union is secure and strong. "Instead of one
tribunal, established by all, responsible to all, with
power to decide for all, shall constitutional questions
be left to four and twenty popular bodies, each
at liberty to decide for itself, and none bound to
respect the decisions of others?"<a name="FNanchor_1484_1484" id="FNanchor_1484_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_1484_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a></p>

<p>Then Webster swept grandly forward to that
famous peroration ending with the words which in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
time became the inspiring motto of the whole American
people: "Liberty <i>and</i> Union, now and forever,
one and inseparable!"<a name="FNanchor_1485_1485" id="FNanchor_1485_1485"></a><a href="#Footnote_1485_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the debate between Hayne
and Webster, Nullification gathered force in South
Carolina. Early in the autumn of 1830, Governor
Stephen Decatur Miller spoke at a meeting of the
Sumter district of that State. He urged that a State
convention be called for the purpose of declaring
null and void the Tariff of 1828. Probably the National
courts would try to enforce that law, he said,
but South Carolina would "refuse to sustain" it.
Nullification involved no danger, and if it did, what
matter!&mdash;"those who fear to defend their rights,
have none. Their property belongs to the banditti:
they are only tenants at will of their own firesides."<a name="FNanchor_1486_1486" id="FNanchor_1486_1486"></a><a href="#Footnote_1486_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a></p>

<p>Public excitement steadily increased; at largely
attended meetings ominous resolutions were adopted.
"The attitude which the federal government continues
to assume towards the southern states, calls for
decisive and unequivocal resistance." So ran a typical
declaration of a gathering of citizens of Georgetown,
South Carolina, in December, 1830.<a name="FNanchor_1487_1487" id="FNanchor_1487_1487"></a><a href="#Footnote_1487_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a></p>

<p>In the Senate, Josiah Stoddard Johnston of Louisiana,
but Connecticut-born, made a speech denouncing
the doctrine of Nullification, asserting the
supremacy of the National Government, and declaring
that the Supreme Court was the final judge of the
constitutionality of legislation. "It has fulfilled the
design of its institution; ... it has given form and
consistency to the constitution, and uniformity to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
the laws."<a name="FNanchor_1488_1488" id="FNanchor_1488_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a> Nullification, said Johnston, means
"either disunion, or civil war; or, in the language
of the times, disunion and blood."<a name="FNanchor_1489_1489" id="FNanchor_1489_1489"></a><a href="#Footnote_1489_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a></p>

<p>The Louisiana Senator sent his speech to Marshall,
who answered that "it certainly is not among the
least extraordinary of the doctrines of the present
day that such a question [Nullification] should be
seriously debated."<a name="FNanchor_1490_1490" id="FNanchor_1490_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a></p>

<p>All Nullification arguments were based on the Kentucky
and Virginia Resolutions. Madison was still living,
and Edward Everett asked him for his views. In
a letter almost as Nationalist as Marshall's opinions,
the venerable statesman replied at great length and
with all the ability and clearness of his best years.</p>

<p>The decision by States of the constitutionality of
acts of Congress would destroy the Nation, he wrote.
Such decision was the province of the National
Judiciary. While the Supreme Court had been criticized,
perhaps justly in some cases, "still it would
seem that, with but few exceptions, the course of the
judiciary has been hitherto sustained by the predominant
sense of the nation." It was absurd to
deny the "supremacy of the judicial power of the
U. S. &amp; denounce at the same time nullifying power
in a State.... A law of the land" cannot be supreme
"without a supremacy in the exposition &amp; execution
of the law." Nullification was utterly destructive
of the Constitution and the Union.<a name="FNanchor_1491_1491" id="FNanchor_1491_1491"></a><a href="#Footnote_1491_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a></p>

<p>This letter, printed in the <i>North American Re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>view</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1492_1492" id="FNanchor_1492_1492"></a><a href="#Footnote_1492_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a>
made a strong impression on the North, but it
only irritated the South. Marshall read it "with peculiar
pleasure," he wrote Story: "M<sup>r</sup> Madison ... is
himself again. He avows the opinions of his best days,
and must be pardoned for his oblique insinuations
that some of the opinions of our Court are not approved.
Contrast this delicate hint with the language
M<sup>r</sup> Jefferson has applied to us. He [Madison] is attacked ... by
our Enquirer, who has arrayed his report
of 1799 against his letter. I never thought
that report could be completely defended; but M<sup>r</sup>
Madison has placed it upon its best ground, that
the language is incautious, but is intended to be confined
to a mere declaration of opinion, or is intended
to refer to that ultimate right which all admit, to
resist despotism, a right not exercised under a constitution,
but in opposition to it."<a name="FNanchor_1493_1493" id="FNanchor_1493_1493"></a><a href="#Footnote_1493_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a></p>

<p>At a banquet on April 15, 1830, in celebration of
Jefferson's birthday, Jackson had given a warning
not to be misunderstood except by Nullifiers who
had been blinded and deafened by their new political
religion. "The Federal Union;&mdash;it must be preserved,"
was the solemn and inspiring toast proposed
by the President. Southern leaders gave no heed.
They apparently thought that Jackson meant to
endorse Nullification, which, most illogically, they
always declared to be the only method of preserving
the Union peaceably.</p>

<p>Their denunciation of the Tariff grew ever louder;
their insistence on Nullification ever fiercer, ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
more determined. To a committee of South Carolina
Union men who invited him to their Fourth of
July celebration at Charleston in 1831, Jackson sent
a letter which plainly informed the Nullifiers that if
they attempted to carry out their threats, the National
Government would forcibly suppress them.<a name="FNanchor_1494_1494" id="FNanchor_1494_1494"></a><a href="#Footnote_1494_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a></p>

<p>At last the eyes of the South were opened. At last
the South understood the immediate purpose of that
enigmatic and self-contradictory man who ruled
America, at times, in the spirit of the Czars of
Russia; at times, in the spirit of the most compromising
of opportunists.</p>

<p>Jackson's outgiving served only to enrage the
South and especially South Carolina. The Legislature
of that State replied to the President's letter
thus: "Is this Legislature to be schooled and rated by
the President of the United States? Is it to legislate
under the sword of the Commander-in-Chief?... This
is a confederacy of sovereign States, and each may
withdraw from the confederacy when it chooses."<a name="FNanchor_1495_1495" id="FNanchor_1495_1495"></a><a href="#Footnote_1495_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a></p>

<p>Marshall saw clearly what the outcome was likely
to be, but yielded slowly to the despair so soon to
master him. "Things to the South wear a very
serious aspect," he tells Story. "If we can trust appearances
the leaders are determined to risk all the
consequences of dismemberment. I cannot entirely
dismiss the hope that they may be deserted by
their followers&mdash;at least to such an extent as to
produce a pause at the Rubicon. They undoubtedly
believe that Virginia will support them. I think they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
are mistaken both with respect to Virginia and North
Carolina. I do not think either State will embrace
this mad and wicked measure. New Hampshire and
Maine seem to belong to the tropics. It is time for
New Hampshire to part with Webster and Mason.
She has no longer any use for such men."<a name="FNanchor_1496_1496" id="FNanchor_1496_1496"></a><a href="#Footnote_1496_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a></p>

<p>As the troubled weeks passed, Marshall's apprehension
increased. Story, profoundly concerned,
wrote the Chief Justice that he could see no light in
the increasing darkness. "If the prospects of our
country inspire you with gloom," answered Marshall,
"how do you think a man must be affected who
partakes of all your opinions and whose geographical
position enables him to see a great deal that is concealed
from you? I yield slowly and reluctantly to
the conviction that our constitution cannot last. I
had supposed that north of the Potowmack a firm
and solid government competent to the security of
rational liberty might be preserved. Even that now
seems doubtful. The case of the south seems to me
to be desperate. Our opinions are incompatible with
a united government even among ourselves. The
union has been prolonged thus far by miracles. I
fear they cannot continue."<a name="FNanchor_1497_1497" id="FNanchor_1497_1497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1497_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a></p>

<p>Congress heeded the violent protest of South Carolina&mdash;perhaps
it would be more accurate to say
that Congress obeyed Andrew Jackson. In 1832 it
reduced tariff duties; but the protective policy was
retained. The South was infuriated&mdash;if the principle
were recognized, said Southern men, what could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
they expect at a later day when this capitalistic,
manufacturing North would be still stronger and the
unmoneyed and agricultural South still weaker?</p>

<p>South Carolina especially was frantic. The spirit
of the State was accurately expressed by R. Barnwell
Smith at a Fourth of July celebration: "If the
fire and the sword of war are to be brought to our
dwellings, ... let them come! Whilst a bush grows
which may be dabbled with blood, or a pine tree
stands to support a rifle, let them come!"<a name="FNanchor_1498_1498" id="FNanchor_1498_1498"></a><a href="#Footnote_1498_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a> At meetings
all over the State treasonable words were
spoken. Governor James Hamilton, Jr., convened
the Legislature in special session and the election
of a State convention was ordered.</p>

<p>"Let us act, next October, at the ballot box&mdash;next
November, in the state house&mdash;and afterwards,
should any further action be necessary, let it be
where our ancestors acted, <i>in the field of battle</i>";<a name="FNanchor_1499_1499" id="FNanchor_1499_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a> such
were the toasts proposed at banquets, such the sentiments
adopted at meetings.</p>

<p>On November 24, 1832, the State Convention,
elected<a name="FNanchor_1500_1500" id="FNanchor_1500_1500"></a><a href="#Footnote_1500_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a> to consider the new Tariff Law, adopted the
famous Nullification Ordinance which declared that
the Tariff Acts of 1828 and 1832 were "null, void, and
no law"; directed the Legislature to take measures
to prevent the enforcement of those acts within
South Carolina; forbade appeal to the Supreme
Court of the United States from South Carolina
courts in any case where the Tariff Law was involved;
and required all State officers, civil and military, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
take oath to "obey, execute and enforce this Ordinance,
and such act or acts of the Legislature as may
be passed in pursuance thereof."</p>

<p>The Ordinance set forth that "we, the People of
South Carolina, ... <i>Do further Declare</i>, that we will
not submit to the application of force, on the part
of the Federal Government, to reduce this State to
obedience; but that we will consider" any act of the
National Government to enforce the Tariff Laws "as
inconsistent with the longer continuance of South
Carolina in the Union: and that the People of this
State ... will forthwith proceed to organize a separate
Government, and to do all other acts and things which
sovereign and independent States may of right do."<a name="FNanchor_1501_1501" id="FNanchor_1501_1501"></a><a href="#Footnote_1501_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a></p>

<p>Thereupon the Convention issued an address to
the people.<a name="FNanchor_1502_1502" id="FNanchor_1502_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_1502_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a> It was long and, from the Nullification
point of view, very able; it ended in an exalted, passionate
appeal: "Fellow citizens, the die is now cast.
<span class="smcap">No more taxes shall be paid here</span>.... Prepare for
the crisis, and ... meet it as becomes men and freemen....
Fellow citizens, <span class="smcap">Do your duty to your
country, and leave the consequences to God</span>."<a name="FNanchor_1503_1503" id="FNanchor_1503_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1503_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a></p>

<p>Excepting only at the outbreak of war could a
people be more deeply stirred than were all Americans
by the desperate action of South Carolina. In
the North great Union meetings were held, fervid
speeches made, warlike resolutions adopted. The
South, at first, seemed dazed. Was war at hand?
This was the question every man asked of his
neighbor. A pamphlet on the situation, written by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
some one in a state of great emotion, had been sent
to Marshall, and Judge Peters had inquired about
it, giving at the same time the name of the author.</p>

<p>"I am not surprised," answered Marshall, "that
he [the author] is excited by the doctrine of nullification.
It is well calculated to produce excitement in
all.... Leaving it to the courts and the custom
house will be leaving it to triumphant victory, and
to victory which must be attended with more pernicious
consequences to our country and with more
fatal consequences to its reputation than victory
achieved in any other mode which rational men can
devise."<a name="FNanchor_1504_1504" id="FNanchor_1504_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a> If Nullification must prevail, John Marshall
preferred that it should win by the sword
rather than through the intimidation of courts.</p>

<p>Jackson rightly felt that his re&euml;lection meant
that the country in general approved of his attitude
toward Nullification as well as that toward the Bank.
He promptly answered the defiance of South Carolina.
On December 10, 1832, he issued his historic
Proclamation. Written by Edward Livingston,<a name="FNanchor_1505_1505" id="FNanchor_1505_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a>
Secretary of State, it is one of the ablest of American
state papers. Moderate in expression, simple in
style, solid in logic, it might have been composed
by Marshall himself. It is, indeed, a restatement of
Marshall's Nationalist reasoning and conclusions.
Like the argument in Webster's Reply to Hayne,
Jackson's Nullification Proclamation was a repetition
of those views of the Constitution and of the
nature of the American Government for which Mar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>shall
had been fighting since Washington was made
President.</p>

<p>As in Webster's great speech, sentences and paragraphs
are in almost the very words used by Marshall
in his Constitutional opinions, so in Jackson's
Proclamation the same parallelism exists. Gently,
but firmly, and with tremendous force, in the style
and spirit of Abraham Lincoln rather than of Andrew
Jackson, the Proclamation makes clear that
the National laws will be executed and resistance
to them will be put down by force of arms.<a name="FNanchor_1506_1506" id="FNanchor_1506_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1506_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a></p>

<p>The Proclamation was a triumph for Marshall.
That the man whom he distrusted and of whom he
so disapproved, whose election he had thought to be
equivalent to a dissolution of the Union, should turn
out to be the stern defender of National solidarity,
was, to Marshall, another of those miracles which so
often had saved the Republic. His disapproval of
Jackson's rampant democracy, and whimsical yet
arbitrary executive conduct, turned at once to hearty
commendation.</p>

<p>"Since his last proclamation and message," testifies
Story, "the Chief Justice and myself have become
his warmest supporters, and shall continue so
just as long as he maintains the principles contained
in them. Who would have dreamed of such an
occurrence?"<a name="FNanchor_1507_1507" id="FNanchor_1507_1507"></a><a href="#Footnote_1507_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a> Marshall realized, nevertheless, that
even the bold course pursued by the President could
not permanently overcome the secession convictions
of the Southern people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span></p>

<p>The Union men of South Carolina who, from the
beginning of the Nullification movement, had striven
earnestly to stay its progress, rallied manfully.<a name="FNanchor_1508_1508" id="FNanchor_1508_1508"></a><a href="#Footnote_1508_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a>
Their efforts were futile&mdash;disunion sentiment swept
the State. "With ... indignation and contempt,"
with "defiance and scorn," most South Carolinians
greeted the Proclamation<a name="FNanchor_1509_1509" id="FNanchor_1509_1509"></a><a href="#Footnote_1509_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a> of the man who, only
three years before, had been their idol. To South
Carolinians Jackson was now "a tyrant," a would-be
"C&aelig;sar," a "Cromwell," a "Bonaparte."<a name="FNanchor_1510_1510" id="FNanchor_1510_1510"></a><a href="#Footnote_1510_1510" class="fnanchor">[1510]</a></p>

<p>The Legislature formally requested Hayne, now
Governor, to issue a counter-proclamation,<a name="FNanchor_1511_1511" id="FNanchor_1511_1511"></a><a href="#Footnote_1511_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a> and
adopted spirited resolutions declaring the right of
any State "to secede peaceably from the Union."
One count in South Carolina's indictment of the
President was thoroughly justified&mdash;his approval
of Georgia's defiance of Marshall and the Supreme
Court. Jackson's action, declared the resolutions,
was the more "extraordinary, that he has silently,
and ... with entire approbation, witnessed our sister
state of Georgia avow, act upon, and carry into effect,
even to the taking of life, principles identical with
those now denounced by him in South Carolina."
The Legislature finally resolved that the State
would "repel force by force, and, relying upon the
blessing of God, will maintain its liberty at all hazards."<a name="FNanchor_1512_1512" id="FNanchor_1512_1512"></a><a href="#Footnote_1512_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a></p>

<p>Swiftly Hayne published his reply to the President's
Proclamation. It summed up all the arguments
for the right of a State to decide the constitu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>tionality
of acts of Congress, that had been made
since the Kentucky Resolutions were written by Jefferson&mdash;that
"great Apostle of American liberty ... who
has consecrated these principles, and left
them as a legacy to the American people, recorded
by his own hand." It was Jefferson, said Hayne, who
had first penned the immortal truth that "<span class="smcap">Nullification</span>"
of unconstitutional acts of Congress was
the "<span class="smcap">rightful remedy</span>" of the States.<a name="FNanchor_1513_1513" id="FNanchor_1513_1513"></a><a href="#Footnote_1513_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a></p>

<p>In his Proclamation Jackson had referred to the
National Judiciary as the ultimate arbiter of the constitutionality
of National laws. How absurd such a
claim by such a man, since that doctrine "has been
denied by none more strongly than the President
himself" in the Bank controversy and in the case of
the Cherokees! "And yet when it serves the purpose
of bringing odium on South Carolina, 'his native
State,' the President has no hesitation in regarding
the attempt of a State to release herself from the control
of the Federal Judiciary, in a matter affecting
her sovereign rights, as a violation of the Constitution."<a name="FNanchor_1514_1514" id="FNanchor_1514_1514"></a><a href="#Footnote_1514_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a></p>

<p>In closing, Governor Hayne declares that "the
time has come when it must be seen, whether
the people of the several States have indeed lost the
spirit of the revolution, and whether they are to
become the willing instruments of an unhallowed
despotism. In such a sacred cause, South Carolina
will feel that she is not striking for her own, but the
liberties of the Union and the <span class="smcap">rights of man</span>."<a name="FNanchor_1515_1515" id="FNanchor_1515_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_1515_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span></p>

<p>Instantly<a name="FNanchor_1516_1516" id="FNanchor_1516_1516"></a><a href="#Footnote_1516_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a> the Legislature enacted one law to
prevent the collection of tariff duties in South Carolina;<a name="FNanchor_1517_1517" id="FNanchor_1517_1517"></a><a href="#Footnote_1517_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a>
another authorizing the Governor to "order
into service the whole military force of this State"
to resist any attempt of the National Government
to enforce the Tariff Acts.<a name="FNanchor_1518_1518" id="FNanchor_1518_1518"></a><a href="#Footnote_1518_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a> Even before Hayne's
Proclamation was published, extensive laws had
been passed for the reorganization of the militia, and
the Legislature now continued to enact similar legislation.
In four days fourteen such acts were passed.<a name="FNanchor_1519_1519" id="FNanchor_1519_1519"></a><a href="#Footnote_1519_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a></p>

<p>The spirit and consistency of South Carolina were
as admirable as her theory was erroneous and narrow.
If she meant what she had said, the State could have
taken no other course. If, moreover, she really intended
to resist the National Government, Jackson
had given cause for South Carolina's militant action.
As soon as the Legislature ordered the calling of the
State Convention to consider the tariff, the President
directed the Collector at Charleston to use every
resource at the command of the Government to collect
tariff duties. The commanders of the forts at
Charleston were ordered to be in readiness to repel
any attack. General Scott was sent to the scene of
the disturbance. Military and naval dispositions
were made so as to enable the National Government
to strike quickly and effectively.<a name="FNanchor_1520_1520" id="FNanchor_1520_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_1520_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a></p>

<p>Throughout South Carolina the rolling of drums
and blare of bugles were heard. Everywhere was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
seen the blue cockade with palmetto button.<a name="FNanchor_1521_1521" id="FNanchor_1521_1521"></a><a href="#Footnote_1521_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a> Volunteers

thousands; in certain districts "almost the entire
population" enlisted.<a name="FNanchor_1523_1523" id="FNanchor_1523_1523"></a><a href="#Footnote_1523_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a> Some regiments adopted a
new flag, a banner of red with a single black star in
the center.<a name="FNanchor_1524_1524" id="FNanchor_1524_1524"></a><a href="#Footnote_1524_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a></p>

<p>Jackson attempted to placate the enraged and
determined State. In his fourth annual Message to
Congress he barely mentioned South Carolina's
defiance, but, for the second time, urgently recommended
a reduction of tariff duties. Protection, he
said, "must be ultimately limited to those articles
of domestic manufacture which are indispensable to
our safety in time of war.... Beyond this object we
have already seen the operation of the system productive
of discontent."<a name="FNanchor_1525_1525" id="FNanchor_1525_1525"></a><a href="#Footnote_1525_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a></p>

<p>Other Southern States, although firmly believing
in South Carolina's principles and sympathetic with
her cause, were alarmed by her bold course. Virginia
essayed the r&ocirc;le of mediator between her warlike
sister and the "usurping" National Government.
In his Message to the Legislature, Governor John
Floyd stoutly defended South Carolina&mdash;"the
land of Sumpter [<i>sic</i>] and of Marion." "Should
force be resorted to by the federal government, the
horror of the scenes hereafter to be witnessed cannot
now be pictured.... What surety has any state for
her existence as a sovereign, if a difference of opinion
should be punished by the sword as treason?"
The situation calls for a reference of the whole ques<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>tion
to "the <span class="smcap">People</span> of the states. On you depends
in a high degree the future destiny of this republic.
It is for you now to say whether the brand of civil
war shall be thrown into the midst of these states."<a name="FNanchor_1526_1526" id="FNanchor_1526_1526"></a><a href="#Footnote_1526_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a></p>

<p>Mediative resolutions were instantly offered for the
appointment of a committee "to take into consideration
the relations existing between the state of South
Carolina and the government of the United States,"
and the results to each and to Virginia flowing from
the Ordinance of Nullification and Jackson's Proclamation.
The committee was to report "such measures
as ... it may be expedient for Virginia to adopt&mdash;the
propriety of recommending a general convention
to the states&mdash;and such a declaration of our
views and opinions as it may be proper for her to
express in the present fearful impending crisis, for
the protection of the right of the states, the restoration
of harmony, and the preservation of the union."<a name="FNanchor_1527_1527" id="FNanchor_1527_1527"></a><a href="#Footnote_1527_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a></p>

<p>Only five members voted against the resolution.<a name="FNanchor_1528_1528" id="FNanchor_1528_1528"></a><a href="#Footnote_1528_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a></p>

<p>The committee was appointed and, on December
20, 1832, reported a set of resolutions&mdash;"worlds of
words," as Niles aptly called them&mdash;disapproving
Jackson's Proclamation; applauding his recommendation
to Congress that the tariff be reduced; regretting
South Carolina's hasty action; deprecating
"the intervention of arms on either side"; entreating
"our brethren in S. Carolina to pause in their
career"; appealing to Jackson "to withstay the
arm of force"; instructing Virginia Senators and requesting
Virginia Representatives in Congress to do
their best to "procure an immediate reduction of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
tariff"; and appointing two commissioners to visit
South Carolina with a view to securing an adjustment
of the dispute.<a name="FNanchor_1529_1529" id="FNanchor_1529_1529"></a><a href="#Footnote_1529_1529" class="fnanchor">[1529]</a></p>

<p>With painful anxiety and grave alarm, Marshall,
then in Richmond, watched the tragic yet absurd
procession of events. Much as the doings and sayings
of the mediators and sympathizers with Nullification
irritated him, serious as were his forebodings, the
situation appealed to his sense of humor. He wrote
Story an account of what was going on in Virginia.
No abler or more accurate statement of the conditions
and tendencies of the period exists. Marshall's
letter is a document of historical importance. It reveals,
too, the character of the man.</p>

<p>It was written in acknowledgment of the receipt
of "a proof sheet" of a page of Story's "Commentaries
on the Constitution of the United States,"
dedicating that work to Marshall. "I am ... deeply
penetrated," says Marshall, "by the evidence it affords
of the continuance of that partial esteem and
friendship which I have cherished for so many years,
and still cherish as one of the choicest treasures of
my life. The only return I can make is locked up in
my own bosom, or communicated in occasional conversation
with my friends." He congratulates Story
on having finished his "Herculean task." He is sure
that Story has accomplished it with ability and "correctness,"
and is "certain in advance" that he will
read "every sentence with entire approbation. It
is a subject on which we concur exactly. Our opin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>ions
on it are, I believe, identical. Not so with Virginia
or the South generally."</p>

<p>Marshall then relates what has happened in Richmond:
"Our legislature is now in session, and the
dominant party receives the message of the President
to Congress with enthusiastic applause. Quite
different was the effect of his proclamation. That
paper astonished, confounded, and for a moment
silenced them. In a short time, however, the power
of speech was recovered, and was employed in bestowing
on its author the only epithet which could
possibly weigh in the scales against the name of
'Andrew Jackson,' and countervail its popularity.</p>

<p>"Imitating the Quaker who said the dog he wished
to destroy was mad, they said Andrew Jackson had
become a Federalist, even an ultra Federalist. To have
said he was ready to break down and trample on
every other department of the government would
not have injured him, but to say that he was a Federalist&mdash;a
convert to the opinions of Washington,
was a mortal blow under which he is yet staggering.</p>

<p>"The party seems to be divided. Those who are
still true to their President pass by his denunciation
of all their former theories; and though they will not
approve the sound opinions avowed in his proclamation
are ready to denounce nullification and to support
him in maintaining the union. This is going
a great way for them&mdash;much farther than their
former declarations would justify the expectation of,
and much farther than mere love of union would
carry them.</p>

<p>"You have undoubtedly seen the message of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
Governor and the resolutions reported by the committee
to whom it was referred&mdash;a message and
resolutions which you will think skillfully framed
had the object been a civil war. They undoubtedly
hold out to South Carolina the expectation of support
from Virginia; and that hope must be the foundation
on which they have constructed their plan
for a southern confederacy or league.</p>

<p>"A want of confidence in the present support of the
people will prevent any direct avowal in favor of this
scheme by those whose theories and whose secret
wishes may lead to it; but the people may be so entangled
by the insane dogmas which have become
axioms in the political creed of Virginia, and involved
so inextricably in the labyrinth into which those
dogmas conduct them, as to do what their sober
judgement disapproves.</p>

<p>"On Thursday these resolutions are to be taken
up, and the debate will, I doubt not, be ardent and
tempestuous enough. I pretend not to anticipate
the result. Should it countenance the obvious design
of South Carolina to form a southern confederacy,
it may conduce to a southern league&mdash;never to
a southern government. Our theories are incompatible
with a government for more than a single State.
We can form no union which shall be closer than an
alliance between sovereigns.</p>

<p>"In this event there is some reason to apprehend
internal convulsion. The northern and western section
of our State, should a union be maintained
north of the Potowmack, will not readily connect itself
with the South. At least such is the present be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>lief
of their most intelligent men. Any effort on their
part to separate from Southern Virginia and unite
with a northern confederacy may probably be punished
as treason. 'We have fallen on evil times.'"</p>

<p>Story had sent Marshall, Webster's speech at Faneuil
Hall, December 17, 1832, in which he declared
that he approved the "general principles" of Jackson's
Proclamation, and that "nullification ... is but
another name for civil war." "I am," said Webster,
"for the Union as it is; ... for the Constitution as
it is." He pledged his support to the President in
"maintaining this Union."<a name="FNanchor_1530_1530" id="FNanchor_1530_1530"></a><a href="#Footnote_1530_1530" class="fnanchor">[1530]</a></p>

<p>Marshall was delighted: "I thank you for M<sup>r</sup>
Webster's speech. Entertaining the opinion he has
expressed respecting the general course of the administration,
his patriotism is entitled to the more credit
for the determination he expressed at Faneuil Hall
to support it in the great effort it promises to make
for the preservation of the union. No member of
the then opposition avowed a similar determination
during the Western Insurrection, which would have
been equally fatal had it not been quelled by the
well timed vigor of General Washington.</p>

<p>"We are now gathering the bitter fruits of the
tree even before that time planted by M<sup>r</sup> Jefferson,
and so industriously and perseveringly cultivated
by Virginia."<a name="FNanchor_1531_1531" id="FNanchor_1531_1531"></a><a href="#Footnote_1531_1531" class="fnanchor">[1531]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's predictions of a tempestuous debate
over the Virginia resolutions were fulfilled. They
were, in fact, "debated to death," records Niles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
"It would seem that the genuine spirit of 'ancient
<i>dominionism</i>' would lead to a making of speeches,
even in 'the cave of the Cyclops when forging thunderbolts,'
instead of striking the hammers from the
hands of the workers of iniquity. Well&mdash;the matter
was debated, and debated and debated.... The
proceedings ... were measured by the <i>square yard</i>."
At last, however, resolutions were adopted.</p>

<p>These resolutions "respectfully requested and entreated"
South Carolina to rescind her Ordinance
of Nullification; "respectfully requested and entreated"
Congress to "modify" the tariff; reaffirmed
Virginia's faith in the principles of 1798-99,
but held that these principles did not justify South
Carolina's Ordinance or Jackson's Proclamation; and
finally, authorized the appointment of one commissioner
to South Carolina to communicate Virginia's
resolutions, expressing at the same time, however,
"our sincere good will to our sister state, and our
anxious solicitude that the kind and respectful recommendations
we have addressed to her, may lead
to an accommodation of all the difficulties between
that state and the general government."<a name="FNanchor_1532_1532" id="FNanchor_1532_1532"></a><a href="#Footnote_1532_1532" class="fnanchor">[1532]</a> Benjamin
Watkins Leigh was unanimously elected to be
the ambassador of accommodation.<a name="FNanchor_1533_1533" id="FNanchor_1533_1533"></a><a href="#Footnote_1533_1533" class="fnanchor">[1533]</a></p>

<p>So it came about that South Carolina, anxious to
extricate herself from a perilous situation, yet ready
to fight if she could not disentangle herself with
honor, took informal steps toward a peaceful adjust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>ment
of the dispute; and that Jackson and Congress,
equally wishing to avoid armed conflict, were eager
to have a tariff enacted that would work a "reconciliation."
On January 26, 1833, at a meeting in
Charleston, attended by the first men of the State of
all parties, resolutions, offered by Hamilton himself,
were adopted which, as a practical matter, suspended
the Ordinance of Nullification that was to
have gone into effect on February 1. Vehement,
spirited, defiant speeches were made, all ending,
however, in expressions of hope that war might be
avoided. The resolutions were as ferocious as the
most bloodthirsty Secessionist could desire; but
they accepted the proposed "beneficial modification
of the tariff," and declared that, "pending the process"
of reducing the tariff, "all ... collision between
the federal and state authorities should be sedulously
avoided on both sides."<a name="FNanchor_1534_1534" id="FNanchor_1534_1534"></a><a href="#Footnote_1534_1534" class="fnanchor">[1534]</a></p>

<p>The Tariff Bill of 1833&mdash;Clay's compromise&mdash;resulted.
Jackson signed it; South Carolina was
mollified. For the time the storm subsided; but the
net result was that Nullification triumphed<a name="FNanchor_1535_1535" id="FNanchor_1535_1535"></a><a href="#Footnote_1535_1535" class="fnanchor">[1535]</a>&mdash;a
National law had been modified at the threat of
a State which was preparing to back up that threat
by force.</p>

<p>Marshall was not deceived. "Have you ever seen
anything to equal the exhibition in Charleston and
in the far South generally?" he writes Story. "Those
people pursue a southern league steadily or they are
insane. They have caught at Clay's bill, if their conduct
is at all intelligible, not as a real accommoda<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>tion,
a real adjustment, a real relief from actual or
supposed oppression, but as an apology for avoiding
the crisis and deferring the decisive moment till the
other States of the South will unite with them."<a name="FNanchor_1536_1536" id="FNanchor_1536_1536"></a><a href="#Footnote_1536_1536" class="fnanchor">[1536]</a>
Marshall himself was for the compromise Tariff of
1833, but not because it afforded a means of preventing
armed collision: "Since I have breathed the
air of James River I think favorably of Clay's bill.
I hope, if it can be maintained, that our manufactures
will still be protected by it."<a name="FNanchor_1537_1537" id="FNanchor_1537_1537"></a><a href="#Footnote_1537_1537" class="fnanchor">[1537]</a></p>

<p>The "settlement" of the controversy, of course,
satisfied nobody, changed no conviction, allayed no
hostility, stabilized no condition. The South, though
victorious, was nevertheless morose, indignant&mdash;after
all, the principle of protection had been retained.
"The political world, at least our part of it,
is surely moved <i>topsy turvy</i>," Marshall writes Story
in the autumn of 1833. "What is to become of us
and of our constitution? Can the wise men of the
East answer that question? Those of the South perceive
no difficulty. Allow a full range to state rights
and state sovereignty, and, in their opinion, all will
go well."<a name="FNanchor_1538_1538" id="FNanchor_1538_1538"></a><a href="#Footnote_1538_1538" class="fnanchor">[1538]</a></p>

<p>Placid as was his nature, perfect as was the co-ordination
of his powers, truly balanced as were his
intellect and emotions, Marshall could not free his
mind of the despondency that had now settled upon
him. Whatever the subject upon which he wrote to
friends, he was sure to refer to the woeful state of
the country, and the black future it portended.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span></p>

<p>Story informed him that an abridged edition of his
own two volumes on the Constitution would soon
be published. "I rejoice to hear that the abridgement
of your Commentaries is coming before the
public," wrote Marshall in reply, "and should be still
more rejoiced to learn that it was used in all our colleges
and universities. The first impressions made on
the youthful mind are of vast importance; and, most
unfortunately, they are in the South all erroneous.
Our young men, generally speaking, grow up in the
firm belief that liberty depends on construing our Constitution
into a league instead of a government; that
it has nothing to fear from breaking these United
States into numerous petty republics. Nothing in
their view is to be feared but that bugbear, consolidation;
and every exercise of legitimate power is
construed into a breach of the Constitution. Your
book, if read, will tend to remove these prejudices."<a name="FNanchor_1539_1539" id="FNanchor_1539_1539"></a><a href="#Footnote_1539_1539" class="fnanchor">[1539]</a></p>

<p>A month later he again writes Story: "I have finished
reading your great work, and wish it could be
read by every statesman, and every would-be statesman
in the United States. It is a comprehensive
and an accurate commentary on our Constitution,
formed in the spirit of the original text. In the
South, we are so far gone in political metaphysics,
that I fear no demonstration can restore us to common
sense. The word 'State Rights,' as expounded
by the resolutions of '98 and the report of '99, construed
by our legislature, has a charm against which
all reasoning is vain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span></p>

<p>"Those resolutions and that report constitute the
creed of every politician, who hopes to rise in Virginia;
and to question them, or even to adopt the construction
given by their author [Jefferson] is deemed
political sacrilege. The solemn ... admonitions of
your concluding remarks<a name="FNanchor_1540_1540" id="FNanchor_1540_1540"></a><a href="#Footnote_1540_1540" class="fnanchor">[1540]</a> will not, I fear, avail as
they ought to avail against this popular frenzy."<a name="FNanchor_1541_1541" id="FNanchor_1541_1541"></a><a href="#Footnote_1541_1541" class="fnanchor">[1541]</a></p>

<p>He once more confides to his beloved Story his
innermost thoughts and feelings. Story had sent the
Chief Justice a copy of the <i>New England Magazine</i>
containing an article by Story entitled "Statesmen:
their Rareness and Importance," in which Marshall
was held up as the true statesman and the poor
quality of the generality of American public men
was set forth in scathing terms.</p>

<p>Marshall briefly thanks Story for the compliment
paid him, and continues: "It is in vain to lament,
that the portrait which the author has drawn of our
political and party men, is, in general, true. Lament
it as we may, much as it may wound our vanity
or our pride, it is still, in the main, true; and will,
I fear, so remain.... In the South, political prejudice
is too strong to yield to any degree of merit;
and the great body of the nation contains, at least
appears to me to contain, too much of the same
ingredient.</p>

<p>"To men who think as you and I do, the present is
gloomy enough; and the future presents no cheering
prospect. The struggle now maintained in every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
State in the Union seems to me to be of doubtful
issue; but should it terminate contrary to the wishes
of those who support the enormous pretensions of
the Executive, should victory crown the exertions
of the champions of constitutional law, what serious
and lasting advantage is to be expected from this
result?</p>

<p>"In the South (things may be less gloomy with
you) those who support the Executive do not support
the Government. They sustain the personal power
of the President, but labor incessantly to impair the
legitimate powers of the Government. Those who
oppose the violent and rash measures of the Executive
(many of them nullifiers, many of them seceders)
are generally the bitter enemies of a constitutional
government. Many of them are the avowed
advocates of a league; and those who do not go the
whole length, go great part of the way. What can
we hope for in such circumstances? As far as I can
judge, the Government is weakened, whatever party
may prevail. Such is the impression I receive from
the language of those around me."<a name="FNanchor_1542_1542" id="FNanchor_1542_1542"></a><a href="#Footnote_1542_1542" class="fnanchor">[1542]</a></p>

<p>During the last years of Marshall's life, the country's
esteem for him, slowly forming through more
than a generation, manifested itself by expressions
of reverence and affection. When he and Story attended
the theater, the audience cheered him.<a name="FNanchor_1543_1543" id="FNanchor_1543_1543"></a><a href="#Footnote_1543_1543" class="fnanchor">[1543]</a> His
sentiment still youthful and tender, he wept over
Fanny Kemble's affecting portrayal of Mrs. Haller
in "The Stranger."<a name="FNanchor_1544_1544" id="FNanchor_1544_1544"></a><a href="#Footnote_1544_1544" class="fnanchor">[1544]</a> To the very last Marshall per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>formed
his judicial duties thoroughly, albeit with
a heavy heart. He "looked more vigorous than
usual," and "seemed to revive and enjoy anew his
green old age," testifies Story.<a name="FNanchor_1545_1545" id="FNanchor_1545_1545"></a><a href="#Footnote_1545_1545" class="fnanchor">[1545]</a></p>

<p>It is at this period of his career that we get Marshall's
account of the course he pursued toward his
malignant personal and political enemy, Thomas Jefferson.
Six years after Jefferson's death,<a name="FNanchor_1546_1546" id="FNanchor_1546_1546"></a><a href="#Footnote_1546_1546" class="fnanchor">[1546]</a> Major
Henry Lee, who hated that great reformer even
more than Jefferson hated Marshall, wrote the Chief
Justice for certain facts, and also for his opinion of
the former President. In his reply Marshall said:</p>

<p>"I have never allowed myself to be irritated by
M<sup>r</sup> Jeffersons unprovoked and unjustifiable aspersions
on my conduct and principles, nor have I ever
noticed them except on one occasion<a name="FNanchor_1547_1547" id="FNanchor_1547_1547"></a><a href="#Footnote_1547_1547" class="fnanchor">[1547]</a> when I thought
myself called on to do so, and when I thought that
declining to enter upon my justification might have
the appearance of crouching under the lash, and
admitting the justice of its infliction."<a name="FNanchor_1548_1548" id="FNanchor_1548_1548"></a><a href="#Footnote_1548_1548" class="fnanchor">[1548]</a></p>

<p>Intensely as he hated Jefferson, attributing to
him, as Marshall did, most of the country's woes,
the Chief Justice never spoke a personally offensive
word concerning his radical cousin.<a name="FNanchor_1549_1549" id="FNanchor_1549_1549"></a><a href="#Footnote_1549_1549" class="fnanchor">[1549]</a> On the other
hand, he never uttered a syllable of praise or appreciation
of Jefferson. Even when his great antagonist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
died, no expression of sorrow or esteem or regret or
admiration came from the Chief Justice. Marshall
could not be either hypocritical or vindictive; but
he could be silent.</p>

<p>Holding to the old-time Federalist opinion that
Jefferson's principles were antagonistic to orderly
government; convinced that, if they prevailed, they
would be destructive of the Nation; believing the
man himself to be a demagogue and an unscrupulous
if astute and able politician&mdash;Marshall,
nevertheless, said nothing about Jefferson to anybody
except to Story, Lee, and Pickering; and, even
to these close friends, he gave only an occasional
condemnation of Jefferson's policies.</p>

<p>The general feeling toward Marshall, especially
that of the bench and bar, during his last two years
is not too strongly expressed in Story's dedication
to the Chief Justice of his "Commentaries on the
Constitution of the United States." Marshall had
taken keen interest in the preparation of Story's
masterpiece and warned him against haste. "Precipitation
ought carefully to be avoided. This is a
subject on which I am not without experience."<a name="FNanchor_1550_1550" id="FNanchor_1550_1550"></a><a href="#Footnote_1550_1550" class="fnanchor">[1550]</a></p>

<p>Story begins by a tribute "to one whose youth was
engaged in the arduous enterprises of the Revolution;
whose manhood assisted in framing and supporting
the national Constitution; and whose maturer years
have been devoted to the task of unfolding its powers,
and illustrating its principles." As the expounder
of the Constitution, "the common consent of your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
countrymen has admitted you to stand without a
rival. Posterity will assuredly confirm, by its deliberate
award, what the present age has approved, as
an act of undisputed justice.</p>

<p>"But," continues Story, "I confess that I dwell
with even more pleasure upon the entirety of a life
adorned by consistent principles, and filled up in the
discharge of virtuous duty; where there is nothing
to regret, and nothing to conceal; no friendships
broken; no confidence betrayed; no timid surrenders
to popular clamor; no eager reaches for popular
favor. Who does not listen with conscious pride to the
truth, that the disciple, the friend, the biographer
of Washington, still lives, the uncompromising advocate
of his principles?"<a name="FNanchor_1551_1551" id="FNanchor_1551_1551"></a><a href="#Footnote_1551_1551" class="fnanchor">[1551]</a></p>

<p>Excepting only the time of his wife's death, the
saddest hours of his life were, perhaps, those when
he opened the last two sessions of the Supreme
Court over which he presided. When, on January
13, 1834, the venerable Chief Justice, leading his associate
justices to their places, gravely returned the
accustomed bow of the bar and spectators, he also,
perforce, bowed to temporary events and to the iron,
if erratic, rule of Andrew Jackson. He bowed, too,
to time and death. Justice Washington was dead,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
Johnson was fatally ill, and Duval, sinking under
age and infirmity, was about to resign.</p>

<p>Republicans as Johnson and Duval were, they
had, generally, upheld Marshall's Nationalism. Their
places must soon be filled, he knew, by men of
Jackson's choosing&mdash;men who would yield to the
transient public pressure then so fiercely brought to
bear on the Supreme Court. Only Joseph Story
could be relied upon to maintain Marshall's principles.
The increasing tendency of Justices Thompson,
McLean, and Baldwin was known to be against
his unyielding Constitutional philosophy. It was
more than probable that, before another year, Jackson
would have the opportunity to appoint two new
Justices&mdash;and two cases were pending that involved
some of Marshall's dearest Constitutional principles.</p>

<p>The first of these was a Kentucky case<a name="FNanchor_1552_1552" id="FNanchor_1552_1552"></a><a href="#Footnote_1552_1552" class="fnanchor">[1552]</a> in which
almost precisely the same question, in principle, arose
that Marshall had decided in Craig <i>vs</i>. Missouri.<a name="FNanchor_1553_1553" id="FNanchor_1553_1553"></a><a href="#Footnote_1553_1553" class="fnanchor">[1553]</a>
The Kentucky Bank, owned by the State, was authorized
to issue, and did issue, bills which were
made receivable for taxes and other public dues. The
Kentucky law furthermore directed that an endorsement
and tender of these State bank notes should,
with certain immaterial modifications, satisfy any
judgment against a debtor.<a name="FNanchor_1554_1554" id="FNanchor_1554_1554"></a><a href="#Footnote_1554_1554" class="fnanchor">[1554]</a> In short, the Legislature
had authorized a State currency&mdash;had emitted
those bills of credit, expressly forbidden by the National
Constitution.</p>

<p>Another case, almost equally important, came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
from New York.<a name="FNanchor_1555_1555" id="FNanchor_1555_1555"></a><a href="#Footnote_1555_1555" class="fnanchor">[1555]</a> To prevent the influx of impoverished
foreigners, who would be a charge upon the
City of New York, the Legislature had enacted that
the masters of ships arriving at that port should report
to the Mayor all facts concerning passengers.
The ship captain must remove those whom the
Mayor decided to be undesirable.<a name="FNanchor_1556_1556" id="FNanchor_1556_1556"></a><a href="#Footnote_1556_1556" class="fnanchor">[1556]</a> It was earnestly
contended that this statute violated the commerce
clause of the Constitution.</p>

<p>Both cases were elaborately argued; both, it was
said, had been settled by former decisions&mdash;the
Kentucky case by Craig <i>vs.</i> Missouri, the New York
case by Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden and Brown <i>vs.</i> Maryland.
The court was almost equally divided. Thompson,
McLean, and Baldwin thought the Kentucky and
New York laws Constitutional; Marshall, Story,
Duval, and Johnson believed them invalid. But
Johnson was absent because of his serious illness.
No decision, therefore, was possible.</p>

<p>Marshall then announced a rule of the court,
hitherto unknown by the public: "The practice of
this court is not (except in cases of absolute necessity)
to deliver any judgment in cases where constitutional
questions are involved, unless four judges concur
in opinion, thus making the decision that of a
majority of the whole court. In the present cases
four judges do not concur in opinion as to the constitutional
questions which have been argued. The
court therefore direct these cases to be re-argued at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
the next term, under the expectation that a larger
number of the judges may then be present."<a name="FNanchor_1557_1557" id="FNanchor_1557_1557"></a><a href="#Footnote_1557_1557" class="fnanchor">[1557]</a></p>

<p>The next term! When, on January 12, 1835, John
Marshall for the last time presided over the Supreme
Court of the United States, the situation, from his
point of view, was still worse. Johnson had died and
Jackson had appointed James M. Wayne of Georgia
in his place. Duval had resigned not long before the
court convened, and his successor had not been
named. Again the New York and Kentucky cases
were continued, but Marshall fully realized that
the decision of them must be in opposition to his
firm and pronounced views.<a name="FNanchor_1558_1558" id="FNanchor_1558_1558"></a><a href="#Footnote_1558_1558" class="fnanchor">[1558]</a></p>

<p>It is doubtful whether history shows more than a
few examples of an aged man, ill, disheartened, and
knowing that he soon must die, who nevertheless
continued his work to the very last with such scrupulous
care as did Marshall. He took active part
in all cases argued and decided and actually delivered
the opinion of the court in eleven of the most
important.<a name="FNanchor_1559_1559" id="FNanchor_1559_1559"></a><a href="#Footnote_1559_1559" class="fnanchor">[1559]</a> None of these are of any historical interest;
but in all of them Marshall was as clear and
vigorous in reasoning and style as he had been in
the immortal Constitutional opinions delivered at the
height of his power. The last words Marshall ever
uttered as Chief Justice sparkle with vitality and
high ideals. In Mitchel <i>et al. vs.</i> The United
States,<a name="FNanchor_1560_1560" id="FNanchor_1560_1560"></a><a href="#Footnote_1560_1560" class="fnanchor">[1560]</a> a case involving land titles in Florida, he
said, in ruling on a motion to continue the case:
"Though the hope of deciding causes to the mutual
satisfaction of parties would be chimerical, that of
convincing them that the case has been fully and
fairly considered ... may be sometimes indulged.
Even this is not always attainable. In the excite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>ment
produced by ardent controversy, gentlemen
view the same object through such different media
that minds, not infrequently receive therefrom precisely
opposite impressions. The Court, however,
must see with its own eyes, and exercise its own
judgment, guided by its own reason."<a name="FNanchor_1561_1561" id="FNanchor_1561_1561"></a><a href="#Footnote_1561_1561" class="fnanchor">[1561]</a></p>

<p>At last Marshall had grave intimations that his
life could not be prolonged. Quite suddenly his health
declined, although his mind was as strong and clear
as ever. "Chief Justice Marshall still possesses his
intellectual powers in very high vigor," writes Story
during the last session of the Supreme Court over
which his friend and leader presided. "But his
physical strength is manifestly on the decline; and
it is now obvious, that after a year or two, he will resign,
from the pressing infirmities of age.... What
a gloom will spread over the nation when he is gone!
His place will not, nay, it cannot be supplied."<a name="FNanchor_1562_1562" id="FNanchor_1562_1562"></a><a href="#Footnote_1562_1562" class="fnanchor">[1562]</a></p>

<p>As the spring of 1835 ripened into summer, Marshall
grew weaker. "I pray God," wrote Story in
agonies of apprehension, "that he may long live to
bless his country; but I confess that I have many
fears whether he can be long with us. His complaints
are, I am sure, incurable, but I suppose that they
may be alleviated, unless he should meet with some
accidental cold or injury to aggravate them. Of
these, he is in perpetual danger, from his imprudence
as well as from the natural effects of age."<a name="FNanchor_1563_1563" id="FNanchor_1563_1563"></a><a href="#Footnote_1563_1563" class="fnanchor">[1563]</a></p>

<p>In May, 1835, Kent went to Richmond in order
to see Marshall, whom "he found very emaciated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
feeble &amp; dangerously low. He injured his Spine by
a Post Coach fall &amp; oversetting.... He ... made me
<i>Promise to see him at Washington next Winter</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1564_1564" id="FNanchor_1564_1564"></a><a href="#Footnote_1564_1564" class="fnanchor">[1564]</a></p>

<p>Kent wrote Jeremiah Smith of New Hampshire
that Marshall must soon die. Smith was overwhelmed
with grief "because his life, at this time
especially, is of incalculable value." Marshall's
"views ... of our national affairs" were those of
Smith also. "Perfectly just in themselves they now
come to us confirmed by the dying attestation of
one of the greatest and best of men."<a name="FNanchor_1565_1565" id="FNanchor_1565_1565"></a><a href="#Footnote_1565_1565" class="fnanchor">[1565]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's "incurable complaint," which so distressed
Story, was a disease of the liver.<a name="FNanchor_1566_1566" id="FNanchor_1566_1566"></a><a href="#Footnote_1566_1566" class="fnanchor">[1566]</a> Finding
his health failing, he again repaired to Philadelphia
for treatment by Dr. Physick. When informed that
the prospects for his friend's recovery were desperate,
Story was inconsolable. "Great, good and
excellent man!" he wrote. "I shall never see his
like again! His gentleness, his affectionateness, his
glorious virtues, his unblemished life, his exalted
talents, leave him without a rival or a peer."<a name="FNanchor_1567_1567" id="FNanchor_1567_1567"></a><a href="#Footnote_1567_1567" class="fnanchor">[1567]</a></p>

<p>At six o'clock in the evening of Monday, July 6,
1835, John Marshall died, in his eightieth year,
in the city where American Independence was proclaimed
and the American Constitution was born&mdash;the
city which, a patriotic soldier, he had striven to
protect and where he had received his earliest national
recognition. Without pain, his mind as clear
and strong as ever, he "met his fate with the forti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>tude
of a Philosopher, and the resignation of a Christian,"
testifies Dr. Nathaniel Chapman, who was
present.<a name="FNanchor_1568_1568" id="FNanchor_1568_1568"></a><a href="#Footnote_1568_1568" class="fnanchor">[1568]</a> By Marshall's direction, the last thing
taken from his body after he expired was the locket
which his wife had hung about his neck just before
she died.<a name="FNanchor_1569_1569" id="FNanchor_1569_1569"></a><a href="#Footnote_1569_1569" class="fnanchor">[1569]</a> The morning after his death, the bar of
Philadelphia met to pay tribute to Marshall, and at
half-past five of the same day a town meeting was
held for the same purpose.<a name="FNanchor_1570_1570" id="FNanchor_1570_1570"></a><a href="#Footnote_1570_1570" class="fnanchor">[1570]</a></p>

<p>Immediately afterward, his body was sent by boat
to Richmond. The bench, bar, and hundreds of citizens
of Philadelphia accompanied the funeral party
to the vessel. During the voyage a transfer was
made to another craft.<a name="FNanchor_1571_1571" id="FNanchor_1571_1571"></a><a href="#Footnote_1571_1571" class="fnanchor">[1571]</a> A committee, consisting of
Major-General Winfield Scott, of the United States
Army, Henry Baldwin, Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court, Richard Peters, formerly Judge for the
District of Pennsylvania, John Sergeant, Edward D.
Ingraham, and William Rawle, of the Philadelphia
bar, went to Richmond.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon of July 9, 1835, the steamboat
Kentucky, bearing Marshall's body, drew up at the
Richmond wharf. Throughout the day the bells had
been tolling, the stores were closed, and, as the vessel
came within sight, a salute of three guns was fired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
All Richmond assembled at the landing. An immense
procession marched to Marshall's house,<a name="FNanchor_1572_1572" id="FNanchor_1572_1572"></a><a href="#Footnote_1572_1572" class="fnanchor">[1572]</a>
where he had requested that his body be first taken,
and then to the "New Burying Ground," on Shockoe
Hill. There Bishop Richard Channing Moore
of the Episcopal Church read the funeral service,
and John Marshall was buried by the side of his wife.</p>

<p>When his ancient enemy and antagonist, the
Richmond <i>Enquirer</i>, published the news of Marshall's
death, it expressed briefly its true estimate of the
man. It would be impossible, said the <i>Enquirer</i>,
to over-praise Marshall's "brilliant talents." It
would be "a more grateful incense" to his memory
to say "that he was as much beloved as he was
respected.... There was about him so little of 'the
insolence of office,' and so much of the benignity
of the man, that his presence always produced ...
the most delightful impressions. There was something
irresistibly winning about him." Strangers
could hardly be persuaded that "in the plain, unpretending<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">... man who told his anecdote and enjoyed</span><br />
the jest&mdash;they had been introduced to the
Chief Justice of the United States, whose splendid
powers had filled such a large space in the eye of
mankind."<a name="FNanchor_1573_1573" id="FNanchor_1573_1573"></a><a href="#Footnote_1573_1573" class="fnanchor">[1573]</a></p>

<p>The Richmond <i>Whig and Public Advertiser</i> said
that "no man has lived or died in this country, save
its father George Washington alone, who united
such a warmth of affection for his person, with so
deep and unaffected a respect for his character, and
admiration for his great abilities. No man ever bore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
public honors with so meek a dignity ... It is hard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">... to conceive of a more perfect character than his,</span><br />
for who can point to a vice, scarcely to a defect&mdash;or
who can name a virtue that did not shine conspicuously
in his life and conduct?"<a name="FNanchor_1574_1574" id="FNanchor_1574_1574"></a><a href="#Footnote_1574_1574" class="fnanchor">[1574]</a></p>

<p>The day after the funeral the citizens of Richmond
gathered at and about the Capitol, again to honor the
memory of their beloved neighbor and friend. The
resolutions, offered by Benjamin Watkins Leigh, declared
that the people of Richmond knew "better
than any other community can know" Marshall's
private and public "virtues," his "wisdom," "simplicity,"
"self-denial," "unbounded charity," and
"warm benevolence towards all men." Since nothing
they can say can do justice to "such a man," the
people of Richmond "most confidently trust, to
History alone, to render due honors to his memory,
by a faithful and immortal record of his wisdom, his
virtues and his services."<a name="FNanchor_1575_1575" id="FNanchor_1575_1575"></a><a href="#Footnote_1575_1575" class="fnanchor">[1575]</a></p>

<p>All over the country similar meetings were held,
similar resolutions adopted. Since the death of
Washington no such universal public expressions
of appreciation and sorrow had been witnessed.<a name="FNanchor_1576_1576" id="FNanchor_1576_1576"></a><a href="#Footnote_1576_1576" class="fnanchor">[1576]</a>
The press of the country bore laudatory editorials
and articles. Even Hezekiah Niles, than whom no
man had attacked Marshall's Nationalist opinions
more savagely, lamented his death, and avowed
himself unequal to the task of writing a tribute to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
Marshall that would be worthy of the subject. "'A
great man has fallen in Israel,'" said Niles's <i>Register</i>.
"Next to <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, only, did he possess
the reverence and homage of the heart of the American
people."<a name="FNanchor_1577_1577" id="FNanchor_1577_1577"></a><a href="#Footnote_1577_1577" class="fnanchor">[1577]</a></p>

<p>One of the few hostile criticisms of Marshall's services
appeared in the <i>New York Evening Post</i> over
the name of "Atlantic."<a name="FNanchor_1578_1578" id="FNanchor_1578_1578"></a><a href="#Footnote_1578_1578" class="fnanchor">[1578]</a> This paper had, by now,
departed from the policy of its Hamiltonian founder.
"Atlantic" said that Marshall's "political doctrines
... were of the ultra federal or aristocratic
kind.... With Hamilton" he "distrusted the virtue
and intelligence of the people, and was in favor
of a strong and vigorous General Government, at
the expense of the rights of the States and of the
people." While he was "sincere" in his beliefs and
"a good and exemplary man" who "truly loved his
country ... he has been, all his life long, a stumbling
block ... in the way of democratic principles....
His situation ... at the head of an important tribunal,
constituted in utter defiance of the very first
principles of democracy, has always been ... an occasion
of lively regret. That he is at length removed
from that station is a source of satisfaction."<a name="FNanchor_1579_1579" id="FNanchor_1579_1579"></a><a href="#Footnote_1579_1579" class="fnanchor">[1579]</a></p>

<p>The most intimate and impressive tributes came,
of course, from Virginia. Scarcely a town in the
State that did not hold meetings, hear orations, adopt
resolutions. For thirty days the people of Lynchburg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
wore crape on the arm.<a name="FNanchor_1580_1580" id="FNanchor_1580_1580"></a><a href="#Footnote_1580_1580" class="fnanchor">[1580]</a> Petersburg honored "the
Soldier, the Orator, the Patriot, the Statesman, the
Jurist, and above all, the good and virtuous man."<a name="FNanchor_1581_1581" id="FNanchor_1581_1581"></a><a href="#Footnote_1581_1581" class="fnanchor">[1581]</a>
Norfolk testified to his "transcendent ability, perfect
integrity and pure patriotism."<a name="FNanchor_1582_1582" id="FNanchor_1582_1582"></a><a href="#Footnote_1582_1582" class="fnanchor">[1582]</a> For weeks
the Virginia demonstrations continued. That at
Alexandria was held five weeks after his death.
"The flags at the public square and on the shipping
were displayed at half mast; the bells were tolled ...
during the day, and minute guns fired by the Artillery";
there was a parade of military companies,
societies and citizens, and an oration by Edgar
Snowden.<a name="FNanchor_1583_1583" id="FNanchor_1583_1583"></a><a href="#Footnote_1583_1583" class="fnanchor">[1583]</a></p>

<p>The keenest grief of all, however, was felt by Marshall's
intimates of the Quoit Club of Richmond.
Benjamin Watkins Leigh proposed, and the club resolved,
that, as to the vacancy caused by Marshall's
death, "there should be no attempt to fill it ever;
but that the number of the club should remain one
less than it was before his death."<a name="FNanchor_1584_1584" id="FNanchor_1584_1584"></a><a href="#Footnote_1584_1584" class="fnanchor">[1584]</a></p>

</p><p>
Soon after the death of his wife, Marshall made his will "entirely
in [his] ... own handwriting." A more informal document of the kind
seldom has been written. It is more like a familiar letter than a legal
paper; yet it is meticulously specific. "I owe nothing on my own
account," he begins. (He specifies one or two small obligations as
trustee for women relatives and as surety for "considerable sums" for
his son-in-law, Jacquelin B. Harvie.) The will shows that he owns
bank and railroad stock and immense quantities of land. He equally
divides his property among his children, making special provision
that the portion of his daughter Mary shall be particularly safeguarded.
</p><p>
One item of the will is curious: "I give to each of my grandsons
named John one thousand acres, part of my tract of land called Canaan
lying in Randolph county. If at the time of my death either of my
sons should have no son living named John, then I give the thousand
acres to any son he may have named Thomas, in token for my love
for my father and veneration for his memory. If there should be no
son named John or Thomas, then I give the land to the eldest son and
if no sons to the daughters."
</p><p>
He makes five additions to his will, three of which he specifically
calls "codicils." One of these is principally "to emancipate my faithful
servant Robin and I direct his emancipation if he <i>chuses</i> to conform
to the laws on that subject, requiring that he should leave the state
or if permission can be obtained for his continuing to reside in it."
If Robin elects to go to Liberia, Marshall gives him one hundred
dollars. "If he does not go there I give him fifty dollars." In case it
should be found "impracticable to liberate" Robin, "I desire that he
may choose his master among my sons, or if he prefer my daughter
that he may be held in trust for her and her family as is the other
property bequeathed in trust for her, and that he may always be
treated as a faithful and meritorious servant." (Will and Codicils
of John Marshall, Records of Henrico County, Richmond, and Fauquier
County, Warrenton, Virginia.)</p></div>

The outspoken and irritable Kent expressed the conservatives'
opinion of Jackson almost as forcibly as Ames stated their views of
Jefferson: "I look upon Jackson as a detestable, ignorant, reckless,
vain and malignant Tyrant.... This American Elective Monarchy
frightens me. The Experiment, with its foundations laid on universal
Suffrage and an unfettered and licentious Press is of too violent a nature
for our excitable People. We have not in our large cities, if we have
in our country, moral firmness enough to bear it. <i>It racks the machine
too much.</i>" (Kent to Story, April 11, 1834, Story MSS. Mass. Hist.
Soc.) In this letter Kent perfectly states Marshall's convictions, which
were shared by nearly every judge and lawyer in America who was
not "in politics."</p></div>

As a young man Marshall had thought so highly of Indians that he
supported Patrick Henry's plan for white amalgamation with them.
(See vol. <span class="smcap">i</span>, 241, of this work.) Yet he did not think our general policy
toward the Indians had been unwise. They were, he wrote Story, "a
fierce and dangerous enemy whose love of war made them sometimes
the aggressors, whose numbers and habits made them formidable, and
whose cruel system of warfare seemed to justify every endeavour to
remove them to a distance from civilized settlements. It was not until
after the adoption of our present government that respect for our
own safety permitted us to give full indulgence to those principles of
humanity and justice which ought always to govern our conduct towards
the aborigines when this course can be pursued without exposing
ourselves to the most afflicting calamities. That time, however,
is unquestionably arrived, and every oppression now exercised on a
helpless people depending on our magnanimity and justice for the preservation
of their existence impresses a deep stain on the American
character. I often think with indignation on our disreputable conduct
(as I think) in the affair of the Creeks of Georgia." (Marshall
to Story, Oct. 29, 1829, <i>Proceedings, Mass. Hist. Soc.</i> 2d Series, <span class="smcap">xiv</span>,
337-38.)</p></div>

of Dec. 24, 1832, <i>ib</i>. 102-05.) Having demonstrated the power of the
State and the impotence of the highest court of the Nation, the
Governor of Georgia, one year after Marshall delivered his opinion,
pardoned Worcester and Butler, but not without protests from the
people.

Two years later, Georgia's victory was sealed by a final successful
defiance of the Supreme Court. One James Graves was convicted
of murder; a writ of error was procured from the Supreme Court; and
a citation issued to Georgia as in the case of George Tassels. The
high spirit of the State, lifted still higher by three successive triumphs
over the Supreme Court, received the order with mingled anger and
derision. Governor Lumpkin threatened secession: "Such attempts, if
persevered in, will eventuate in the dismemberment and overthrow
of our great confederacy," he told the Legislature. (Governor Lumpkin's
Special Message to the Georgia Legislature, Nov. 7, 1834, as
quoted in Phillips, 84.)

The Indians finally were forced to remove to the Indian Territory.
(See Phillips, 83.) Worcester went to his Vermont home.</p></div>

This was the Constitutional theory of the Nationalists. As a matter
of fact, it was not, perhaps, strictly true. There can be little doubt
that a majority of the people did not favor the Constitution when
adopted by the Convention and ratified by the States. Had manhood
suffrage existed at that time, and had the Constitution been submitted
directly to the people, it is highly probable that it would have
been rejected. (See vol. <span class="smcap">i</span>, chaps, <span class="smcap">ix-xii</span>, of this work.)</p></div>

Story's perfervid eulogium did not overstate the feeling&mdash;the instinct&mdash;of
the public. Nathan Sargent, that trustworthy writer of
reminiscences, testifies that, toward the end of Marshall's life, his
name had "become a household word with the American people
implying greatness, purity, honesty, and all the Christian virtues."

Taney of Maryland took his seat on the bench as Marshall's successor.
Philip Pendleton Barbour of Virginia succeeded Duval. Of the
seven Justices, only one disciple of Marshall remained, Joseph Story.
</p><p>
In the New York case the court held that the State law was a local
police regulation. (11 Peters, 130-43; 144-53.) Story dissented in
a signally able opinion of almost passionate fervor.
</p><p>
"I have the consolation to know," he concludes, "that I had the
entire concurrence ... of that great constitutional jurist, the late Mr.
Chief Justice Marshall. Having heard the former arguments, his deliberate
opinion was that the act of New York was unconstitutional,
and that the present case fell directly within the principles established
in the case of Gibbons v. Ogden." (<i>Ib.</i> 153-61.)
</p><p>
In the Kentucky Bank case, decided immediately after the New
York immigrant case, Marshall's opinion in Craig <i>vs.</i> Missouri was
completely repudiated, although Justice McLean, who delivered the
opinion of the court (<i>ib.</i> 311-28), strove to show that the judgment
was within Marshall's reasoning.
</p><p>
Story, of course, dissented, and never did that extraordinary man
write with greater power and brilliancy. When the case was first argued
in 1834, he said, a majority of the court "were decidedly of the
opinion" that the Kentucky Bank Law was unconstitutional. "In
principle it was thought to be decided by the case of Craig v. The
State of Missouri." Among that majority was Marshall&mdash;"a name
never to be pronounced without reverence." (<i>Ib.</i> 328.)
</p><p>
In closing his great argument, Story says that the frankness and
fervor of his language are due to his "reverence and affection" for Marshall.
"I have felt an earnest desire to vindicate his memory.... I am
sensible that I have not done that justice to his opinion which his own
great mind and exalted talents would have done. But ... I hope that
I have shown that there were solid grounds on which to rest his exposition
of the Constitution. <i>His saltem accumulem donis, et fungar inani
munere.</i>" (11 Peters, 350.)</p></div>
